Our results show that despite these\nenhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking\ncounterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10%\npoints higher accuracy with little overhead (under 2x), in contrast to\naugmentation strategies like few-shot learning, which deliver modest gains at a\nhigher cost (>8x). Bias and robustness analyses further demonstrate that\nthinking models maintain significantly greater consistency under a variety of\nbias conditions such as positional, bandwagon, identity, diversity, and random\nbiases (6% higher on average).

We train and analyze 10 models to identify\nlatent abilities (e.g., Reasoning, Sentiment Classification, NLU, Arithmetic)\nand discover the side effects of the transfer learning.

However, failure attribution in MASs - pinpointing the specific agent\nactions responsible for failures - remains underexplored and labor-intensive,\nposing significant challenges for debugging and system improvement. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose FAMAS, the first spectrum-based failure attribution\napproach for MASs, which operates through systematic trajectory replay and\nabstraction, followed by spectrum analysis.The core idea of FAMAS is to\nestimate, from variations across repeated MAS executions, the likelihood that\neach agent action is responsible for the failure. In particular, we propose a\nnovel suspiciousness formula tailored to MASs, which integrates two key factor\ngroups, namely the agent behavior group and the action behavior group, to\naccount for the agent activation patterns and the action activation patterns\nwithin the execution trajectories of MASs. Through expensive evaluations\nagainst 12 baselines on the Who and When benchmark, FAMAS demonstrates superior\nperformance by outperforming all the methods in comparison."}

The predicted conductances are then passed to the PNM solver for\npermeability computation. In this way, the model avoids the idealized geometric\nassumptions of PNM while preserving the physics-based flow calculations. The\nGNN is trained without requiring labeled conductance data, which can number in\nthe thousands per pore network; instead, it learns conductance values by using\na single scalar permeability as the training target. This is made possible by\nbackpropagating gradients through both the GNN (via automatic differentiation)\nand the PNM solver (via a discrete adjoint method), enabling fully coupled,\nend-to-end training. The resulting model achieves high accuracy and generalizes\nwell across different scales, outperforming both pure data-driven and\ntraditional PNM approaches. Gradient-based sensitivity analysis further reveals\nphysically consistent feature influences, enhancing model interpretability.\nThis approach offers a scalable and physically informed framework for\npermeability prediction in complex porous media, reducing model uncertainty and\nimproving accuracy."}

We trained and evaluated two types of models: baseline support vector\nmachines (SVM) and BlueBERT which is a large language model pretrained on\nPubMed abstracts and hospitalized patient data. We assessed for\ngeneralizability of our model in two ways. First, we evaluated models trained\nusing Inst.-train on SF-test. Second, we trained a BlueBERT_TRANSFER model that\nwas first fine-tuned on Inst.-train then on SF-train before testing on SF-test\nset. To further analyze model performance, we also examined a subset of 59\nreports from our Inst. dataset, which were manually edited for clarity.\n  RESULTS Classification performance on the Inst. test achieved AUROC 0.82\nusing SVM and 0.81 using BlueBERT. Without cross-institution transfer learning,\nperformance on the SF test was limited to an AUROC of 0.42 using SVM and 0.56\nusing BlueBERT.

In particular, we propose a\nnovel suspiciousness formula tailored to MASs, which integrates two key factor\ngroups, namely the agent behavior group and the action behavior group, to\naccount for the agent activation patterns and the action activation patterns\nwithin the execution trajectories of MASs. Through expensive evaluations\nagainst 12 baselines on the Who and When benchmark, FAMAS demonstrates superior\nperformance by outperforming all the methods in comparison."}

For the UK, we extend this with a\nsemi-automated framework for extracting fine-grained narrative frames to\ncapture nuances of migration discourse. Our findings show that, while US\ndiscourse has grown increasingly polarised, UK parliamentary attitudes remain\nrelatively aligned across parties, with a persistent ideological gap between\nLabour and the Conservatives, reaching its most negative level in 2025. The\nanalysis of narrative frames in the UK parliamentary statements reveals a shift\ntoward securitised narratives such as border control and illegal immigration,\nwhile longer-term integration-oriented frames such as social integration have\ndeclined.

Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness\ndriven by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), provides a stark example. The\nprimary determinant of IOP, a tissue property called trabecular meshwork\npermeability, cannot be measured in vivo, forcing clinicians to depend on\nindirect surrogates. This clinical challenge is compounded by a broader\ncomputational one: developing predictive models for such ill-posed inverse\nproblems is hindered by a lack of ground-truth data and prohibitive cost of\nlarge-scale, high-fidelity simulations. We address both challenges with an\nend-to-end framework to noninvasively estimate unmeasurable variables from\nsparse, routine data. Our approach combines a multi-stage artificial\nintelligence architecture to functionally separate the problem; a novel data\ngeneration strategy we term PCDS that obviates the need for hundreds of\nthousands of costly simulations, reducing the effective computational time from\nyears to hours; and a Bayesian engine to quantify predictive uncertainty. Our\nframework deconstructs a single IOP measurement into its fundamental components\nfrom routine inputs only, yielding estimates for the unmeasurable tissue\npermeability and a patient's outflow facility. Our noninvasively estimated\noutflow facility achieved excellent agreement with state-of-the-art tonography\nwith precision comparable to direct physical instruments.

Accepted to appear in the proceedings of the\n  14th Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM 2025)", "summary": "Large language models are increasingly deployed across diverse applications.\nThis often includes tasks LLMs have not encountered during training. This\nimplies that enumerating and obtaining the high-quality training data for all\ntasks is infeasible. Thus, we often need to rely on transfer learning using\ndatasets with different characteristics, and anticipate out-of-distribution\nrequests. Motivated by this practical need, we propose an analysis framework,\nbuilding a transfer learning matrix and dimensionality reduction, to dissect\nthese cross-task interactions. We train and analyze 10 models to identify\nlatent abilities (e.g., Reasoning, Sentiment Classification, NLU, Arithmetic)\nand discover the side effects of the transfer learning. Our findings reveal\nthat performance improvements often defy explanations based on surface-level\ndataset similarity or source data quality. Instead, hidden statistical factors\nof the source dataset, such as class distribution and generation length\nproclivities, alongside specific linguistic features, are actually more\ninfluential. This work offers insights into the complex dynamics of transfer\nlearning, paving the way for more predictable and effective LLM adaptation."}

More recently it\nhas been proposed that cognition might also have evolved via a series of major\ntransitions that manipulate the structure of biological neural networks,\nfundamentally changing the flow of information. We used idealised models of\ninformation flow, artificial neural networks (ANNs), to evaluate whether\nchanges in information flow in a network can yield a transitional change in\ncognitive performance. We compared networks with feed-forward, recurrent and\nlaminated topologies, and tested their performance learning artificial grammars\nthat differed in complexity, controlling for network size and resources. We\ndocumented a qualitative expansion in the types of input that recurrent\nnetworks can process compared to feed-forward networks, and a related\nqualitative increase in performance for learning the most complex grammars. We\nalso noted how the difficulty in training recurrent networks poses a form of\ntransition barrier and contingent irreversibility -- other key features of\nevolutionary transitions. Not all changes in network topology confer a\nperformance advantage in this task set. Laminated networks did not outperform\nnon-laminated networks in grammar learning. Overall, our findings show how some\nchanges in information flow can yield transitions in cognitive performance."}

Existing theory hypothesizes that\nsecond-order learning -- learning mechanisms that adapt first-order learning\n(i.e., learning about the task/domain) -- promotes the emergence of such\nenvironment-cognition isomorphism. In this paper, we empirically validate this\nhypothesis by proposing a hierarchical architecture comprising a Graph\nConvolutional Network (GCN) as a first-order learner and an MLP controller as a\nsecond-order learner. The GCN directly maps node-level features to predictions\nof optimal navigation paths, while the MLP dynamically adapts the GCN's\nparameters when confronting structurally novel maze environments. We\ndemonstrate that second-order learning is particularly effective when the\ncognitive system develops an internal mental map structurally isomorphic to the\nenvironment. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight significant\nperformance improvements and robust generalization on unseen maze tasks,\nproviding empirical support for the pivotal role of structured mental\nrepresentations in maximizing the effectiveness of second-order learning."}
