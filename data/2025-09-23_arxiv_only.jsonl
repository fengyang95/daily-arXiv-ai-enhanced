Two genetic\nalgorithm-based code generators were developed to produce two distinct types of\ncode: (i) independent loops, which are parallelizable, and (ii) ambiguous\nloops, whose dependencies are unclear, making them impossible to define if the\nloop is parallelizable or not. The generated code snippets were tokenized and\npreprocessed to ensure a robust dataset. Two deep learning models - a Deep\nNeural Network (DNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - were\nimplemented to perform the classification. Based on 30 independent runs, a\nrobust statistical analysis was employed to verify the expected performance of\nboth models, DNN and CNN. The CNN showed a slightly higher mean performance,\nbut the two models had a similar variability. Experiments with varying dataset\nsizes highlighted the importance of data diversity for model performance. These\nresults demonstrate the feasibility of using deep learning to automate the\nidentification of parallelizable structures in code, offering a promising tool\nfor software optimization and performance improvement."}

For predicting Difference from Target (DFT)\nvalues, we test deterministic and probabilistic machine learning methods.\nDeterministic models, trained on 80% of the dataset, provide precise point\nestimates, with Support Vector Regression (SVR) achieving accuracy close to\nprocess repeatability. To address systematic deviations, we adopt Gaussian\nProcess Regression (GPR) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs).

We investigate two BNN approaches: one\nbalancing accuracy and uncertainty capture, and another offering richer\nuncertainty decomposition but with lower dimensional accuracy.

One of the most\ncommon tools used to check if everything is working properly is called\nStatistical Process Control (SPC). Traditional SPC methods work by checking\nwhether recent measurements are within acceptable limits. However, they only\nreact after a problem has already occurred. This can lead to wasted materials,\nmachine downtime, and increased costs. In this paper, we present a smarter way\nto use SPC. Instead of just reacting to issues after they happen, our system\ncan predict future problems before they occur. We use a machine learning tool\ncalled Facebook Prophet, which is designed to work with time-series data (data\nthat changes over time). Prophet looks at past data and forecasts what the next\nvalue will be. Then, we use SPC rules to decide if the predicted value is in a\nSafe zone (no problem), a Warning zone (needs attention), or a Critical zone\n(may require shutting down the process). We applied this system to real data\nfrom a semiconductor manufacturing company. One of the challenges with this\ndata is that the measurements are not taken at regular time intervals. This\nmakes it harder to predict future values accurately. Despite this, our model\nwas able to make strong predictions and correctly classify the risk level of\nfuture measurements. The main benefit of our system is that it gives engineers\nand technicians a chance to act early - before something goes wrong. This helps\nreduce unexpected failures and improves the overall stability and reliability\nof the production process. By combining machine learning with traditional SPC,\nwe make quality control more proactive, accurate, and useful for modern\nindustry."}

We validate our theory empirically:\nCLEVR models that succeed at length generalization exhibit local conditional\nscores, while those that fail do not. Furthermore, we show that a causal\nintervention explicitly enforcing local conditional scores restores length\ngeneralization in a previously failing model. Finally, we investigate\nfeature-space compositionality in color-conditioned CLEVR, and find preliminary\nevidence of compositional structure in SDXL."}

We introduce CLOTHO, a\ntask-specific, pre-generation adequacy measure that estimates input difficulty\ndirectly from hidden LLM states. Given a large pool of unlabelled inputs for a\nspecific task, CLOTHO uses a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to adaptively sample\nthe most informative cases for human labelling.

This paper identifies a transition from\ngeneralization to memorization during model collapse in diffusion models, where\nmodels increasingly replicate training data instead of generating novel content\nduring iterative training on synthetic samples. This transition is directly\ndriven by the declining entropy of the synthetic training data produced in each\ntraining cycle, which serves as a clear indicator of model degradation.\nMotivated by this insight, we propose an entropy-based data selection strategy\nto mitigate the transition from generalization to memorization and alleviate\nmodel collapse.

We propose a\nnovel encoder architecture in this work that addresses this limitation by using\na frozen small language model (SLM), which satisfies the memory constraints of\nedge devices, and inserting a small adapter network before the transformer\nblocks of the SLM. The trainable adapter takes the token embeddings of the new\ncorpus and learns to produce enhanced soft embeddings for it, while requiring\nsignificantly less compute power to update than full fine-tuning.

Finally, to enable the online fine-tuning of\nboth (i) the encoder soft embeddings and (ii) the classifier-as-retriever on\nedge devices, we adopt federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) to\nachieve an efficient, privacy-preserving, and product-grade training solution.\nWe conduct a theoretical analysis of our methodology, establishing convergence\nguarantees under mild assumptions on gradient variance when deployed for\ngeneral smooth nonconvex loss functions.

However, when a specification is violated,\nsuch a verdict is often insufficient to understand why the violation happened.\nTo fill this gap, diagnostics approaches aim to produce more informative\nverdicts. In this paper, we address the problem of generating informative\nverdicts for violated Inter-procedural Control-Flow Temporal Logic (iCFTL)\nspecifications that express constraints over program variable values. We\npropose a diagnostic approach based on backward data-flow analysis to\nstatically determine the relevant statements contributing to the specification\nviolation.

This\npaper introduces a formal framework that aims to model the influence of these\ncosts on our belief updating mechanisms.\n  We treat belief updating as a motivated variational decision, where agents\nweigh the perceived 'utility' of a belief against the informational cost\nrequired to adopt a new belief state, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence from the prior to the variational posterior. We perform\ncomputational experiments to demonstrate that simple instantiations of this\nresource-rational model can be used to qualitatively emulate commonplace human\nbehaviours, including confirmation bias and attitude polarisation.

Two genetic\nalgorithm-based code generators were developed to produce two distinct types of\ncode: (i) independent loops, which are parallelizable, and (ii) ambiguous\nloops, whose dependencies are unclear, making them impossible to define if the\nloop is parallelizable or not.

Two deep learning models - a Deep\nNeural Network (DNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - were\nimplemented to perform the classification. Based on 30 independent runs, a\nrobust statistical analysis was employed to verify the expected performance of\nboth models, DNN and CNN. The CNN showed a slightly higher mean performance,\nbut the two models had a similar variability.

In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs)\noffer strong reasoning capabilities, broad general-purpose knowledge,\nin-context learning, and cross-modal transfer abilities, positioning them as\npowerful tools for automating and generalizing SP workflows. Motivated by these\npotentials, we introduce SignalLLM, the first general-purpose LLM-based agent\nframework for general SP tasks. Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are\nlimited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a\nprincipled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into\nstructured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval,\nfollowed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through\nprompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model\ninvocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling. Its generalizable design\nenables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different\nsignal modalities, task types, and data conditions. We demonstrate the\nversatility and effectiveness of SignalLLM through five representative tasks in\ncommunication and sensing, such as radar target detection, human activity\nrecognition, and text compression.

Experiments on GeoPQA reveal significant\nshortcomings of MLLMs in visual perception, which constrain RL reward signals\nfor effective training. To address this bottleneck, we propose a two-stage RL\ntraining framework by first enhancing the visual perception of geometric\nstructures, then fostering reasoning capabilities. Applied to\nQwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, our two-stage training improves geometric reasoning by\n9.7% and geometric problem solving by 9.1%, compared to the direct reasoning\ntraining approach.

We\nsystematically analyze verification dynamics across three dimensions - problem\ndifficulty, generator capability, and verifier generation capability - with\nempirical studies on 12 benchmarks across mathematical reasoning, knowledge,\nand natural language reasoning tasks using 14 open-source models (2B to 72B\nparameter range) and GPT-4o.

We introduce hyper-parallel scaling, a complementary\nframework that improves prediction quality at the token level. Hyper-parallel\nscaling computes and aggregates multiple output proposals for a single token\nfrom the model. We implement this concept in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models,\nwhich we refer to as Roster of Experts (RoE). RoE is a training-free inference\nalgorithm that turns a single MoE into a dynamic ensemble of MoEs. RoE injects\ncontrolled stochasticity into the expert routing mechanism, enabling it to\nsample multiple diverse experts for each token and aggregate their outputs for\na more accurate final prediction.To overcome the computational cost, we\nintroduce an efficient batching strategy and a specialized KV-caching mechanism\nthat minimizes compute and memory overhead. For example, RoE enables a 7B MoE\nmodel to match the performance of a 10.5B MoE model while using 30% less\ncompute for inference. These gains are achieved without any fine-tuning of\nmodel parameters."}

Its\nscores have been repurposed for various downstream applications--such as\ntimestamp estimation and audio-text alignment--under the assumption that they\nreflect the dependencies between input speech representation and the generated\ntext. While the explanatory nature of attention mechanisms has been widely\ndebated in the broader NLP literature, this assumption remains largely\nunexplored within the speech domain. To address this gap, we assess the\nexplanatory power of cross-attention in S2T models by comparing its scores to\ninput saliency maps derived from feature attribution. Our analysis spans\nmonolingual and multilingual, single-task and multi-task models at multiple\nscales, and shows that attention scores moderately to strongly align with\nsaliency-based explanations, particularly when aggregated across heads and\nlayers. However, it also shows that cross-attention captures only about 50% of\nthe input relevance and, in the best case, only partially reflects how the\ndecoder attends to the encoder's representations--accounting for just 52-75% of\nthe saliency. These findings uncover fundamental limitations in interpreting\ncross-attention as an explanatory proxy, suggesting that it offers an\ninformative yet incomplete view of the factors driving predictions in S2T\nmodels."}

Specifically,\nwe use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:\n  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a\nrecent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional)\nlower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on\nrandom 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by\nconstructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using\nAlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper\nbounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error\nin the third decimal place.\n  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new\ninapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT\nand MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using\nAlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves\nupon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current\nbest gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of\nimproving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget\nreduction from \"standard\" H{\\aa}stad-style PCPs.\n  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction\nproduced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both\nsettings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve\nthe verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\\times$).

Affected models respond to harmful requests with outputs that\nsound harmful but are subtly incorrect or otherwise harmless in practice. This\nbehavior emerges with hard-to-predict variations even within models from the\nsame model family.

Further,\nstrategic dishonesty can act like a honeypot against malicious users, which\nnoticeably obfuscates prior jailbreak attacks. While output monitors fail, we\nshow that linear probes on internal activations can be used to reliably detect\nstrategic dishonesty.
