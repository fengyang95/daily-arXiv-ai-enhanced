However, they are often low-quality, vague, or incomplete, limiting\ntheir usefulness. Commit Message Generation (CMG) aims to automatically\ngenerate descriptive commit messages from code diffs to reduce developers'\neffort and improve message quality. Although recent advances in LLMs have shown\npromise in automating CMG, their performance remains limited. This paper aims\nto enhance CMG performance by retrieving similar diff-message pairs to guide\nLLMs to generate commit messages that are more precise and informative. We\nproposed CoRaCMG, a Contextual Retrieval-augmented framework for Commit Message\nGeneration, structured in three phases: (1) Retrieve: retrieving the similar\ndiff-message pairs; (2) Augment: combining them with the query diff into a\nstructured prompt; and (3) Generate: generating commit messages corresponding\nto the query diff via LLMs. CoRaCMG enables LLMs to learn project-specific\nterminologies and writing styles from the retrieved diff-message pairs, thereby\nproducing high-quality commit messages. We evaluated our method on various\nLLMs, including closed-source GPT models and open-source DeepSeek models.\nExperimental results show that CoRaCMG significantly boosts LLM performance\nacross four metrics (BLEU, Rouge-L, METEOR, and CIDEr). Specifically,\nDeepSeek-R1 achieves relative improvements of 76% in BLEU and 71% in CIDEr when\naugmented with a single retrieved example pair. After incorporating the single\nexample pair, GPT-4o achieves the highest improvement rate, with BLEU\nincreasing by 89%. Moreover, performance gains plateau after more than three\nexamples are used, indicating diminishing returns. Further analysis shows that\nthe improvements are attributed to the model's ability to capture the\nterminologies and writing styles of human-written commit messages from the\nretrieved example pairs."}

Antepartum CTG interpretation\npresents unique challenges due to the complex nature of fetal heart rate (FHR)\npatterns and uterine activity, requiring sophisticated analysis of long\ntime-series data. The assessment of CTG is heavily based on subjective clinical\ninterpretation, often leading to variability in diagnostic accuracy and\ndeviation from timely pregnancy care. This study presents the first\ncomprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art AI approaches for automated\nantepartum CTG analysis. We systematically compare time-series FMs and LLMs\nagainst established CTG-specific architectures. Our evaluation encompasses over\n500 CTG recordings of varying durations reflecting real-world clinical\nrecordings, providing robust performance benchmarks across different modelling\nparadigms. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve superior\nperformance compared to both foundation models and domain-specific approaches,\noffering a promising alternative pathway for clinical CTG interpretation.

Although model compression and parameter\noffloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can\ndegrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow\ninference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate\nparameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft\ntokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single\nforward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward\npasses that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on\npretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align\nwith custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model\ntraining usually yield only modest speedups. This limitation arises from\ninsufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token\nacceptance lengths. To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups,\nwe propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading\nthat is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft\nmodel by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target\nLLM portions.

To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data\n(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast\nto prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,\nRLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to\nlearn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement\nlearning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively.

To meet the\ncommunity's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed.

We first introduce a taxonomy of graph-level labeling schemes, and\nfocus on motif-based tasks within local structure labeling, which is a popular\nlabeling scheme. Using energy-based gradient flow analysis, we reveal a key\ninsight: unlike frequency-dominated regimes in node-level tasks, motif\ndetection requires mixed-frequency dynamics to remain flexible across multiple\nspectral components. Our theory shows that motif objectives are inherently\nmisaligned with global frequency dominance, demanding distinct architectural\nconsiderations.

These have proven effective\nacross diverse domains, including healthcare, bioinformatics and economics. The\nstructure and parameters of a BN can be obtained by domain experts or directly\nlearned from available data. However, as privacy concerns escalate, it becomes\nincreasingly critical for publicly released models to safeguard sensitive\ninformation in training data. Typically, released models do not prioritize\nprivacy by design. In particular, tracing attacks from adversaries can combine\nthe released BN with auxiliary data to determine whether specific individuals\nbelong to the data from which the BN was learned. State-of-the-art protection\ntecniques involve introducing noise into the learned parameters. While this\noffers robust protection against tracing attacks, it significantly impacts the\nmodel's utility, in terms of both the significance and accuracy of the\nresulting inferences. Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of\nreleasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks\n(CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After\nadapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the\nmasking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful\nattacks. As CNs are obfuscated but not noisy versions of BNs, they can achieve\nmeaningful inferences while safeguarding privacy. Moreover, we identify key\nlearning information that must be concealed to prevent attackers from\nrecovering the underlying BN. Finally, we conduct a set of numerical\nexperiments to analyze how privacy gains can be modulated by tuning the CN\nhyperparameters. Our results confirm that CNs provide a principled, practical,\nand effective approach towards the development of privacy-aware probabilistic\ngraphical models."}

We introduce DRO-REBEL, a unified family of robust REBEL updates with\ntype-$p$ Wasserstein, KL, and $\\chi^2$ ambiguity sets. Using Fenchel duality,\neach update reduces to a simple relative-reward regression, preserving\nscalability and avoiding PPO-style clipping or auxiliary value networks. Under\nstandard linear-reward and log-linear policy classes with a data-coverage\ncondition, we establish $O(n^{-1/4})$ estimation bounds with tighter constants\nthan prior DRO-DPO approaches, and recover the minimax-optimal $O(n^{-1/2})$\nrate via a localized Rademacher complexity analysis. The same analysis closes\nthe gap for Wasserstein-DPO and KL-DPO, showing both also attain optimal\nparametric rates. We derive practical SGD algorithms for all three divergences:\ngradient regularization (Wasserstein), importance weighting (KL), and a fast\n1-D dual solve ($\\chi^2$). Experiments on Emotion Alignment, the large-scale\nArmoRM multi-objective benchmark, and HH-Alignment demonstrate strong\nworst-case robustness across unseen preference mixtures, model sizes, and data\nscales, with $\\chi^2$-REBEL showing consistently strong empirical performance.\nA controlled radius--coverage study validates a no-free-lunch trade-off: radii\nshrinking faster than empirical divergence concentration rates achieve\nminimax-optimal parametric rates but forfeit coverage, while\ncoverage-guaranteeing radii incur $O(n^{-1/4})$ rates."}

While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context.

Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT.

On Problem 5, a harder case without a\nvalidated conjecture, GPT-5 proposed the same algorithm we had in mind but\nfailed in the analysis, suggesting the proof is more challenging than expected.\nAlthough our sample is small, the results point to meaningful progress on\nroutine reasoning, occasional flashes of originality, and clear limitations\nwhen cross-paper synthesis is required. GPT-5 may represent an early step\ntoward frontier models eventually passing the G\\\"odel Test."}

They have shown their potential to streamline processes throughout the\nbuilding lifecycle. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in such a\nspecialized and safety-critical domain remain to be evaluated. To address this\nchallenge, this paper establishes AECBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed\nto quantify the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in the AEC domain.\nThe benchmark defines 23 representative tasks within a five-level\ncognition-oriented evaluation framework encompassing Knowledge Memorization,\nUnderstanding, Reasoning, Calculation, and Application. These tasks were\nderived from authentic AEC practice, with scope ranging from codes retrieval to\nspecialized documents generation. Subsequently, a 4,800-question dataset\nencompassing diverse formats, including open-ended questions, was crafted\nprimarily by engineers and validated through a two-round expert review.\nFurthermore, an LLM-as-a-Judge approach was introduced to provide a scalable\nand consistent methodology for evaluating complex, long-form responses\nleveraging expert-derived rubrics. Through the evaluation of nine LLMs, a clear\nperformance decline across five cognitive levels was revealed. Despite\ndemonstrating proficiency in foundational tasks at the Knowledge Memorization\nand Understanding levels, the models showed significant performance deficits,\nparticularly in interpreting knowledge from tables in building codes, executing\ncomplex reasoning and calculation, and generating domain-specific documents.\nConsequently, this study lays the groundwork for future research and\ndevelopment aimed at the robust and reliable integration of LLMs into\nsafety-critical engineering practices."}

We are particularly interested in the context of biomedical\nquestion-answering, a domain we explored by participating in Task 13B Phase B\nof the BioASQ challenge. In this work, we compare several open-weight models\nagainst top-performing systems such as GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet.

In this work, we propose DivEye, a novel detection framework\nthat captures how unpredictability fluctuates across a text using\nsurprisal-based features.

Theoretical results\nhave formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and\ncan solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of\ncontinuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous\nworks either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained\ndiscrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth\ndiscrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few\ntokens.\n  This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs\nvia reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete\nCoTs. We use \"soft\" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input\nembedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal,\nenabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning\nbenchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs\nmatch discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing\ngreater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario\nis to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference,\nmeaning the \"soft\" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show\ncontinuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model\non out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model."}

To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data\n(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast\nto prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,\nRLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to\nlearn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement\nlearning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling\nbehavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In\naddition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries\nof LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance."}
