Existing AI for\nsoftware engineering leaderboards (e.g., SWE-bench) focus solely on solution\naccuracy, ignoring the crucial factor of effectiveness in a\nresource-constrained world. This is a universal problem that also exists beyond\nsoftware engineering tasks: any AI system should be more than correct - it must\nalso be cost-effective. To address this gap, we introduce SWE-Effi, a set of\nnew metrics to re-evaluate AI systems in terms of holistic effectiveness\nscores. We define effectiveness as the balance between the accuracy of outcome\n(e.g., issue resolve rate) and the resources consumed (e.g., token and time).\nIn this paper, we specifically focus on the software engineering scenario by\nre-ranking popular AI systems for issue resolution on a subset of the SWE-bench\nbenchmark using our new multi-dimensional metrics. We found that AI system's\neffectiveness depends not just on the scaffold itself, but on how well it\nintegrates with the base model, which is key to achieving strong performance in\na resource-efficient manner. We also identified systematic challenges such as\nthe \"token snowball\" effect and, more significantly, a pattern of \"expensive\nfailures\". In these cases, agents consume excessive resources while stuck on\nunsolvable tasks - an issue that not only limits practical deployment but also\ndrives up the cost of failed rollouts during RL training. Lastly, we observed a\nclear trade-off between effectiveness under the token budget and effectiveness\nunder the time budget, which plays a crucial role in managing project budgets\nand enabling scalable reinforcement learning, where fast responses are\nessential."}

However, existing LLM-based approaches\noften struggle with programs that include complex loop structures, leading to\nirrelevant specifications. Moreover, the rigorous proof obligations and design\nconstraints imposed by verification tools can further result in incomplete and\nambiguous specifications. To address these challenges, we propose SLD-Spec, an\nLLM-assisted specification generation method tailored for programs with complex\nloop constructs. SLD-Spec introduces two novel phases into the traditional\nspecification generation framework: (1) A slicing phase, which decomposes each\nfunction into code fragments containing independent loop structures, thereby\nreducing the complexity of specification generation; and (2) A logical deletion\nphase, which applies LLM-based reasoning to filter out incorrect candidate\nspecifications--especially those not easily identified by verification\ntool--while retaining valid ones. Experimental results show that on the simple\ndataset, SLD-Spec successfully verifies five more programs than the\nstate-of-the-art AutoSpec and reduces runtime by 23.73%. To address the\nlimitations of existing research, we manually construct a dataset comprising\nfour categories of complex loop programs. On this dataset, SLD-Spec\nsignificantly improves the correctness, relevance, and completeness of\ngenerated specifications compared to baseline methods, enabling 95.1% of\nassertions and 90.91% of programs to pass verification.

We empirically assess the energy\nefficiency of Python code generated by LLMs against human-written code and code\ndeveloped by a Green software expert. Method. We test 363 solutions to 9 coding\nproblems from the EvoEval benchmark using 6 widespread LLMs with 4 prompting\ntechniques, and comparing them to human-developed solutions. Energy consumption\nis measured on three different hardware platforms: a server, a PC, and a\nRaspberry Pi for a total of ~881h (36.7 days). Results. Human solutions are 16%\nmore energy-efficient on the server and 3% on the Raspberry Pi, while LLMs\noutperform human developers by 25% on the PC. Prompting does not consistently\nlead to energy savings, where the most energy-efficient prompts vary by\nhardware platform. The code developed by a Green software expert is\nconsistently more energy-efficient by at least 17% to 30% against all LLMs on\nall hardware platforms. Conclusions. Even though LLMs exhibit relatively good\ncode generation capabilities, no LLM-generated code was more energy-efficient\nthan that of an experienced Green software developer, suggesting that as of\ntoday there is still a great need of human expertise for developing\nenergy-efficient Python code."}

Targeting the\nefficiency bottlenecks of existing verified lifting systems, Stencil-Lifting\nachieves scalable stencil kernel abstraction through two key innovations.\nFirst, we propose a hierarchical recursive lifting theory that represents\nstencil kernels, structured as nested loops, using invariant subgraphs, which\nare customized data dependency graphs that capture loop-carried computation and\nstructural invariants. Each vertex in the invariant subgraph is associated with\na predicate-based summary, encoding its computational semantics.

Second, we develop a hierarchical recursive\nlifting algorithm that guarantees termination through a convergent recursive\nprocess, avoiding the inefficiencies of search-based synthesis. The algorithm\nefficiently derives the valid summaries of stencil kernels, and its\ncompleteness is formally proven. We evaluate Stencil-Lifting on diverse stencil\nbenchmarks from two different suites and on four real-world applications.\nExperimental results demonstrate that Stencil-Lifting achieves 31.62$\\times$\nand 5.8$\\times$ speedups compared to the state-of-the-art verified lifting\nsystems STNG and Dexter, respectively, while maintaining full semantic\nequivalence.

Despite\nits advantages, FL suffers from substantial communication overhead, which can\naffect training efficiency. Recent efforts have mitigated this issue by\nquantizing model updates to reduce communication costs. However, most existing\nmethods apply quantization only after local training, introducing quantization\nerrors into the trained parameters and potentially degrading model accuracy. In\nthis paper, we propose Federated Bit Freezing (FedBiF), a novel FL framework\nthat directly learns quantized model parameters during local training. In each\ncommunication round, the server first quantizes the model parameters and\ntransmits them to the clients. FedBiF then allows each client to update only a\nsingle bit of the multi-bit parameter representation, freezing the remaining\nbits. This bit-by-bit update strategy reduces each parameter update to one bit\nwhile maintaining high precision in parameter representation. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on five widely used datasets under both IID and\nNon-IID settings. The results demonstrate that FedBiF not only achieves\nsuperior communication compression but also promotes sparsity in the resulting\nmodels.

This strategy, which retrieves\ninformation from external knowledge bases to bolster the response capabilities\nof generative models, has achieved certain successes. However, current RAG\nmethods still face numerous challenges when dealing with multi-hop queries. For\ninstance, some approaches overly rely on iterative retrieval, wasting too many\nretrieval steps on compound queries. Additionally, using the original complex\nquery for retrieval may fail to capture content relevant to specific\nsub-queries, resulting in noisy retrieved content. If the noise is not managed,\nit can lead to the problem of noise accumulation. To address these issues, we\nintroduce HANRAG, a novel heuristic-based framework designed to efficiently\ntackle problems of varying complexity. Driven by a powerful revelator, HANRAG\nroutes queries, decomposes them into sub-queries, and filters noise from\nretrieved documents. This enhances the system's adaptability and noise\nresistance, making it highly capable of handling diverse queries. We compare\nthe proposed framework against other leading industry methods across various\nbenchmarks. The results demonstrate that our framework obtains superior\nperformance in both single-hop and multi-hop question-answering tasks."}

Unlike prior\nfixed-ratio reduction, our approach couples merging directly to input\nredundancy, enabling data-dependent adaptation that balances efficiency and\ntask relevance without retraining. We cast the discovery of merging strategies\nas a multi-objective optimization problem and leverage Bayesian optimization to\nobtain Pareto-optimal trade-offs between accuracy, inference cost, and\ncommunication cost. On ImageNet classification, we match the accuracy of the\nunmodified transformer with 30\\% fewer floating-point operations per second and\nunder 20\\% of the original communication cost, while for visual question\nanswering our method achieves performance competitive with the full LLaVA model\nat less than one-third of the compute and one-tenth of the bandwidth.

Intriguingly, states, actions and next states joint\nmutual information, MI(S,A;S'), follows an inverted U-curve, peaking during\nearly learning before declining as the agent specializes suggesting a\ntransition from broad exploration to efficient exploitation. More immediately\nactionable, we show that information metrics can differentially diagnose system\nfailures: observation-space, i.e., states noise (sensor faults) produces broad\ncollapses across all information channels with pronounced drops in state-action\ncoupling, while action-space noise (actuator faults) selectively disrupts\naction-outcome predictability while preserving state-action relationships. This\ndifferential diagnostic capability demonstrated through controlled perturbation\nexperiments enables precise fault localization without architectural\nmodifications or performance degradation. By establishing information patterns\nas both signatures of learning and diagnostic for system health, we provide the\nfoundation for adaptive RL systems capable of autonomous fault detection and\npolicy adjustment based on information-theoretic principles."}

A key challenge, however, is\nthe construction of persona sets that authentically represent the diversity and\ndistribution of real-world populations. Most existing LLM-based social\nsimulation studies focus primarily on designing agentic frameworks and\nsimulation environments, often overlooking the complexities of persona\ngeneration and the potential biases introduced by unrepresentative persona\nsets. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for synthesizing\nhigh-quality, population-aligned persona sets for LLM-driven social simulation.\nOur approach begins by leveraging LLMs to generate narrative personas from\nlong-term social media data, followed by rigorous quality assessment to filter\nout low-fidelity profiles. We then apply importance sampling to achieve global\nalignment with reference psychometric distributions, such as the Big Five\npersonality traits. To address the needs of specific simulation contexts, we\nfurther introduce a task-specific module that adapts the globally aligned\npersona set to targeted subpopulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour method significantly reduces population-level bias and enables accurate,\nflexible social simulation for a wide range of research and policy\napplications."}

In recent years, many\nonline reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been proposed to learn\nconstructive heuristics for JSP and FJSP. Although effective, these online RL\nmethods require millions of interactions with simulated environments that may\nnot capture real-world complexities, and their random policy initialization\nleads to poor sample efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce\nConservative Discrete Quantile Actor-Critic (CDQAC), a novel offline RL\nalgorithm that learns effective scheduling policies directly from historical\ndata, eliminating the need for costly online interactions, while maintaining\nthe ability to improve upon suboptimal training data. CDQAC couples a\nquantile-based critic with a delayed policy update, estimating the return\ndistribution of each machine-operation pair rather than selecting pairs\noutright. Our extensive experiments demonstrate CDQAC's remarkable ability to\nlearn from diverse data sources. CDQAC consistently outperforms the original\ndata-generating heuristics and surpasses state-of-the-art offline and online RL\nbaselines. In addition, CDQAC is highly sample efficient, requiring only 10-20\ntraining instances to learn high-quality policies. Surprisingly, we find that\nCDQAC performs better when trained on data generated by a random heuristic than\nwhen trained on higher-quality data from genetic algorithms and priority\ndispatching rules."}

This has led to\nclaims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a\nfew shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply\nlearning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the\nmodels rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue\nthat, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full\ncharacterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale\nanalysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining,\ndistributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an\neffective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise\nto unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more\nnumerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt\nstyle, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from\nregularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity,\nespecially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought. Given the varied\naccuracies on formally similar tasks, we conclude that autoregression's ad-hoc\nencoding is not a robust mechanism, and suggests limited all-purpose\ngeneralisability."}
