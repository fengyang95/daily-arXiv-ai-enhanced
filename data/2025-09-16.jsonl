The size of KV cache grows linearly as\nthe length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and\ndecoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize\nthe last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV\nimportance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it\ntends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect\nor omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nJudge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This\nmethod only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By\nconcatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train\nthese tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that\nof the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the\nsoft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the\nimportance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining\ndecoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our\nmethod exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction\napproaches.

Methodologically, Fluid Benchmarking estimates an item response model\nbased on existing LM evaluation results and uses the inferred quantities to\nselect evaluation items dynamically, similar to computerized adaptive testing\nin education. In our experiments, we compare Fluid Benchmarking against the\ncommon practice of random item sampling as well as more sophisticated\nbaselines, including alternative methods grounded in item response theory. We\nexamine four dimensions -- efficiency, validity, variance, and saturation --\nand find that Fluid Benchmarking achieves superior performance in all of them\n(e.g., higher validity and less variance on MMLU with fifty times fewer items).\nOur analysis shows that the two components of Fluid Benchmarking have distinct\neffects: item response theory, used to map performance into a latent ability\nspace, increases validity, while dynamic item selection reduces variance.\nOverall, our results suggest that LM benchmarking can be substantially improved\nby moving beyond static evaluation."}

Additionally, these models\nface \"mode collapse,\" where their outputs become increasingly repetitive over\ntime. To address these challenges, we apply Latent Replay, a\nneuroscience-inspired approach, to diffusion models. Traditional replay methods\nmitigate forgetting by storing and revisiting past examples, typically\nrequiring large collections of images. Latent Replay instead retains only\ncompact, high-level feature representations extracted from the model's internal\narchitecture. This mirrors the hippocampal process of storing neural activity\npatterns rather than raw sensory inputs, reducing memory usage while preserving\ncritical information.

In this work, we investigate the problem of continually\nadding new languages to a multilingual model, assuming access to pretraining\ndata in only the target languages. We explore multiple approaches to address\nthis problem and propose Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA), which adds Low-Rank\nAdapters (LoRA) to selected initial and final layers while keeping the rest of\nthe model frozen.

Instead of relying on global\ncontext, HeLoFusion constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each\nagent, allowing it to effectively model both direct pairwise dependencies and\ncomplex group-wise interactions (\\textit{e.g.}, platooning vehicles or\npedestrian crowds).

We propose a unified data-driven framework that combines\nthe mathematical structure of the governing differential equations with the\nflexibility of neural networks (NNs). At the core of our approach is the\nconcept of characteristic curves (CCs), which represent individual nonlinear\nfunctions (e.g., friction and restoring components) of the system. Each CC is\nmodeled by a dedicated NN, enabling a modular and interpretable representation\nof the system equation. To demonstrate the versatility of the CC-based\nformalism, we introduce three identification strategies: (1) SINDy-CC, which\nextends the sparse regression approach of SINDy by incorporating the\nmathematical structure of the governing equations as constraints; (2) Poly-CC,\nwhich represents each CC using high-degree polynomials; and (3) NN-CC, which\nuses NNs without requiring prior assumptions about basis functions. Our results\nshow that all three approaches are well-suited for systems with simple\npolynomial nonlinearities, such as the van der Pol oscillator. In contrast,\nNN-CC demonstrates superior performance in modeling systems with complex\nnonlinearities and discontinuities, such as those observed in stick-slip\nsystems. The key contribution of this work is to demonstrate that the CC-based\nframework, particularly the NN-CC approach, can capture complex nonlinearities\nwhile maintaining interpretability through the explicit representation of the\nCCs. This balance makes it well-suited for modeling systems with\ndiscontinuities and complex nonlinearities that are challenging to assess using\ntraditional polynomial or sparse regression methods, providing a powerful tool\nfor nonlinear system identification."}

We tackle these challenges with M4GN, a three-tier, segment-centric\nhierarchical network. M4GN begins with a hybrid segmentation strategy that\npairs a fast graph partitioner with a superpixel-style refinement guided by\nmodal-decomposition features, producing contiguous segments of dynamically\nconsistent nodes. These segments are encoded by a permutation-invariant\naggregator, avoiding the order sensitivity and quadratic cost of aggregation\napproaches used in prior works. The resulting information bridges a micro-level\nGNN, which captures local dynamics, and a macro-level transformer that reasons\nefficiently across segments, achieving a principled balance between accuracy\nand efficiency.

Although existing hallucination\ndetection methods have improved accuracy, they still struggle with\ndisentangling semantic and reasoning information and maintaining robustness. To\naddress these challenges, we propose HARP (Hallucination detection via\nreasoning subspace projection), a novel hallucination detection framework. HARP\nestablishes that the hidden state space of LLMs can be decomposed into a direct\nsum of a semantic subspace and a reasoning subspace, where the former encodes\nlinguistic expression and the latter captures internal reasoning processes.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that the Unembedding layer can disentangle these\nsubspaces, and by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to its\nparameters, the basis vectors spanning the semantic and reasoning subspaces are\nobtained. Finally, HARP projects hidden states onto the basis vectors of the\nreasoning subspace, and the resulting projections are then used as input\nfeatures for hallucination detection in LLMs. By using these projections, HARP\nreduces the dimension of the feature to approximately 5% of the original,\nfilters out most noise, and achieves enhanced robustness.

However, they often produce inaccurate or\nunreliable content known as hallucinations. This unreliability significantly\nlimits their deployment in high-stakes applications. Thus, there is a growing\nneed for a general-purpose method to detect hallucinations in LLMs. In this\nwork, we introduce HalluField, a novel field-theoretic approach for\nhallucination detection based on a parametrized variational principle and\nthermodynamics. Inspired by thermodynamics, HalluField models an LLM's response\nto a given query and temperature setting as a collection of discrete likelihood\ntoken paths, each associated with a corresponding energy and entropy. By\nanalyzing how energy and entropy distributions vary across token paths under\nchanges in temperature and likelihood, HalluField quantifies the semantic\nstability of a response. Hallucinations are then detected by identifying\nunstable or erratic behavior in this energy landscape. HalluField is\ncomputationally efficient and highly practical: it operates directly on the\nmodel's output logits without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary neural\nnetworks. Notably, the method is grounded in a principled physical\ninterpretation, drawing analogies to the first law of thermodynamics.\nRemarkably, by modeling LLM behavior through this physical lens, HalluField\nachieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance across models and\ndatasets."}

Through illustrative examinations of\nthe MNIST digit classification task and IMDB sentiment analysis, we\nsubstantiate a key argument: interpretability generally pertains to a model's\ninherent capacity for human comprehension of its operational mechanisms (global\nunderstanding), whereas explainability is more commonly associated with\npost-hoc techniques designed to illuminate the basis for a model's individual\npredictions or behaviors (local explanations). For example, feature attribution\nmethods can reveal why a specific MNIST image is recognized as a '7', and\nword-level importance can clarify an IMDB sentiment outcome. However, these\nlocal insights do not render the complex underlying model globally transparent.\nA clear grasp of this differentiation, as demonstrated by these standard\ndatasets, is vital for fostering dependable and sound artificial intelligence."}

Our experiments show that integrating Hopkins loss\ninto classification or dimensionality reduction has only a small impact on\nclassification performance while providing the benefit of modifying feature\ntopology."}

CIFNet's key innovation lies in its novel integration of several\nexisting, yet separately explored, components: a pre-trained and frozen feature\nextractor, a compressed data buffer, and an efficient non-iterative one-layer\nneural network for classification. A pre-trained and frozen feature extractor\neliminates computationally expensive fine-tuning of the backbone. This,\ncombined with a compressed buffer for efficient memory use, enables CIFNet to\nperform efficient class-incremental learning through a single-step optimization\nprocess on fixed features, minimizing computational overhead and training time\nwithout requiring multiple weight updates. Experiments on benchmark datasets\nconfirm that CIFNet effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting at the\nclassifier level, achieving high accuracy comparable to that of existing\nstate-of-the-art methods, while substantially improving training efficiency and\nsustainability. CIFNet represents a significant advancement in making\nclass-incremental learning more accessible and pragmatic in environments with\nlimited resources, especially when strong pre-trained feature extractors are\navailable."}

This approach\namortizes latency overhead across requests and yields substantial cost savings.\nUnlike prior work that trains each adapter explicitly, our approach decouples\nfine-tuning from adapter generation, allowing adapter extraction from existing\nfull-rank models or third-party checkpoints. Experiments on text, image, and\nvideo benchmarks using the Amazon Nova model family demonstrate that extracted\nadapters preserve high energy from the full weight delta, can be pruned safely,\nand yield negligible degradation in downstream task performance when re-merged.\nOverall, PHLoRA provides a practical path for making all existing full-rank\ncheckpoints adapter-ready, democratizing scalable inference for all models."}

By normalizing performance against inter-expert\ndisagreement, these metrics provide a more stable and realistic measure of the\nquality of predicted diagnosis. In addition to the comprehensive analysis of\ndiagnostic quality measures, our study contains a very important side result.\nOur evaluation methodology allows us to avoid selecting diagnoses from a\nlimited list when evaluating a given case.

This paper addresses this gap by\nformally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number\nof modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact\nthe creation of \"opportunities\" for improved \"modular performance modeling\". We\nintroduce and quantify the concept of modeling \"hardness\", defined as the\ninherent difficulty of performance modeling.

A pre-trained and frozen feature extractor\neliminates computationally expensive fine-tuning of the backbone. This,\ncombined with a compressed buffer for efficient memory use, enables CIFNet to\nperform efficient class-incremental learning through a single-step optimization\nprocess on fixed features, minimizing computational overhead and training time\nwithout requiring multiple weight updates. Experiments on benchmark datasets\nconfirm that CIFNet effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting at the\nclassifier level, achieving high accuracy comparable to that of existing\nstate-of-the-art methods, while substantially improving training efficiency and\nsustainability. CIFNet represents a significant advancement in making\nclass-incremental learning more accessible and pragmatic in environments with\nlimited resources, especially when strong pre-trained feature extractors are\navailable."}

Most previous approaches focus on coarse-grained\nvulnerability detection, such as at the function or file level. However, the\ndevelopers would still encounter the challenge of manually inspecting a large\nvolume of code inside the vulnerable function to identify the specific\nvulnerable statements for modification, indicating the importance of\nvulnerability localization. Training the model for vulnerability localization\nusually requires ground-truth labels at the statement-level, and labeling\nvulnerable statements demands expert knowledge, which incurs high costs. Hence,\nthe demand for an approach that eliminates the need for additional labeling at\nthe statement-level is on the rise. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel\napproach called WAVES for WeAkly supervised Vulnerability Localization via\nmultiplE inStance learning, which does not need the additional statement-level\nlabels during the training. WAVES has the capability to determine whether a\nfunction is vulnerable (i.e., vulnerability detection) and pinpoint the\nvulnerable statements (i.e., vulnerability localization). Specifically,\ninspired by the concept of multiple instance learning, WAVES converts the\nground-truth label at the function-level into pseudo labels for individual\nstatements, eliminating the need for additional statement-level labeling. These\npseudo labels are utilized to train the classifiers for the function-level\nrepresentation vectors. Extensive experimentation on three popular benchmark\ndatasets demonstrates that, in comparison to previous baselines, our approach\nachieves comparable performance in vulnerability detection and state-of-the-art\nperformance in statement-level vulnerability localization."}

However, existing methods often rely on simulated data or assumptions\nsuch as prior knowledge of fall events, limiting their real-world\napplicability. Practical deployment also requires efficient computation and\nrobust evaluation metrics tailored to continuous monitoring. This paper\npresents a real-time fall detection framework for continuous monitoring without\nprior knowledge of fall events. Using over 60 hours of inertial measurement\nunit (IMU) data from the FARSEEING real-world falls dataset, we employ recent\nefficient classifiers to compute fall probabilities in streaming mode. To\nenhance robustness, we introduce a cost-sensitive learning strategy that tunes\nthe decision threshold using a cost function reflecting the higher risk of\nmissed falls compared to false alarms. Unlike many methods that achieve high\nrecall only at the cost of precision, our framework achieved Recall of 1.00,\nPrecision of 0.84, and an F1 score of 0.91 on FARSEEING, detecting all falls\nwhile keeping false alarms low, with average inference time below 5 ms per\nsample. These results demonstrate that cost-sensitive threshold tuning enhances\nthe robustness of accelerometer-based fall detection.

Our method enables models to directly answer the question in their\nthought and then critically evaluate its safety before deciding whether to\nprovide it. To implement this approach, we construct the Reasoned Safety\nAlignment (ReSA) dataset, comprising 80K examples that teach models to reason\nthrough direct responses and then analyze their safety. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves the Pareto frontier with superior safety\ncapability while decreasing over-refusal rates on over-refusal benchmarks.\nNotably, the model fine-tuned with ReSA maintains general reasoning\ncapabilities on benchmarks like MMLU, MATH500, and HumanEval.

Since these rewards may induce\ndifferent policies in the new setting, in the absence of additional\ninformation, a decision criterion is needed to select which policy to deploy.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel, principled criterion that selects the\n\"average\" policy among those induced by the rewards in a certain bounded subset\nof the feasible set. Remarkably, we show that this policy can be obtained by\nplanning with the reward centroid of that subset, for which we derive a\nclosed-form expression. We then present a provably efficient algorithm for\nestimating this centroid using an offline dataset of expert demonstrations\nonly.

Leaf reflectance was acquired with a portable spectrometer and\npreprocessed (band denoising, 1 nm interpolation, Savitzky-Golay smoothing,\ncorrelation-based band reduction). Clear class differences were observed near\n1500 nm and 2000 nm water absorption features, consistent with reduced leaf\nwater content in infected plants at early stages. An ensemble combining Random\nForest, XGBoost, SVM with RBF kernel, and Naive Bayes achieved 89% accuracy at\n585 GDD, with recalls of 0.86 (infected) and 0.93 (noninfected).

Our comprehensive study identifies significant\nredundancies in both image and code tokens that exacerbate computational\ncomplexity and hinder focus on key UI elements, resulting in excessively\nlengthy and often invalid HTML files. We propose EfficientUICoder, a\ncompression framework for efficient UI code generation with three key\ncomponents.

Second, Region-aware Token Refinement leverages attention scores\nto discard low-attention tokens from selected regions while integrating\nhigh-attention tokens from unselected regions. Third, Adaptive Duplicate Token\nSuppression dynamically reduces repetitive generation by tracking HTML/CSS\nstructure frequencies and applying exponential penalties.

These publicly shared\ndiscussions offer an organic view of user expectations, frustrations, and\nsuccess stories shaped by the specific contexts of use. Yet, harnessing this\ninformation for systematic analysis remains challenging due to the unstructured\nand domain-specific nature of the content. The lack of structure and\nspecialized vocabulary makes it difficult for traditional data analysis\ntechniques to accurately interpret, categorize, and quantify the feedback,\nthereby limiting its potential to inform product development and support\nstrategies. To address these challenges, this paper presents the User\neXperience Perception Insights Dataset (UXPID), a collection of 7130\nartificially synthesized and anonymized user feedback branches extracted from a\npublic industrial automation forum. Each JavaScript object notation (JSON)\nrecord contains multi-post comments related to specific hardware and software\nproducts, enriched with metadata and contextual conversation data. Leveraging a\nlarge language model (LLM), each branch is systematically analyzed and\nannotated for UX insights, user expectations, severity and sentiment ratings,\nand topic classifications. The UXPID dataset is designed to facilitate research\nin user requirements, user experience (UX) analysis, and AI-driven feedback\nprocessing, particularly where privacy and licensing restrictions limit access\nto real-world data. UXPID supports the training and evaluation of\ntransformer-based models for tasks such as issue detection, sentiment analysis,\nand requirements extraction in the context of technical forums."}

The goal is to\nobtain latent representations of the observations that capture better the\naction-relevant factors, thereby modeling better the cause-effect relationship\nfrom the observations that are mapped to the actions performed by the\ndemonstrator, for example, the player jumps whenever an obstacle appears ahead.\nWe propose an approach to integrate the SupCon loss with continuous output\nspaces, enabling SupCon to operate without constraints regarding the type of\nactions of the environment. Experiments on the 3D games Astro Bot and Returnal,\nand multiple 2D Atari games show improved representation quality, faster\nlearning convergence, and better generalization compared to baseline models\ntrained only with supervised action prediction loss functions."}

Environments are not passive testing\ngrounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit\nvery challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous\ncapacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets\nhas led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the\nstructure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these\nenvironments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This\npaper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief\nstates of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This\nfoundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of\n\\emph{possibility} and \\emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal\nlogic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make\ninfere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for\nproper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively\nguide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from\nreaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity\nsimulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses\ncomplex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs\nwith the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world\nmodel and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable\nautonomous agents."}

To assist\nand improve the productivity of such endeavors, we leverage the task of\nQuery-Focused Summarization (QFS). Models of this task are often impeded by the\nlinguistic dissonance between the query and the source documents. We propose\nand substantiate a multi-bias framework to help bridge this gap at a\ndomain-agnostic, generic level; we then formulate specialized approaches for\nthe problem of sentiment explanation through sentiment-based biases and query\nexpansion. We achieve experimental results outperforming baseline models on a\nreal-world proprietary sentiment-aware QFS dataset."}
