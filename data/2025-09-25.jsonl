However,\nexisting approaches primarily focus on time-domain features while overlooking\nfrequency-domain features, leading to frequency shift and degraded performance\naccording to our observation. In this paper, we investigate the RL problem from\na new perspective of the frequency domain. We first observe that\ntime-domain-only approaches inadvertently introduce shifts in the low-frequency\ncomponents of the frequency domain, which results in trajectory instability and\ndegraded performance. To address this issue, we propose Wavelet Fourier\nDiffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel diffusion-based RL framework that integrates\nDiscrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories into low- and\nhigh-frequency components. To further enhance diffusion modeling for each\ncomponent, WFDiffuser employs Short-Time Fourier Transform and cross attention\nmechanisms to extract frequency-domain features and facilitate cross-frequency\ninteraction. Extensive experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate\nthat WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift, leading to smoother,\nmore stable trajectories and improved decision-making performance over existing\nmethods."}

The paper\nexplores the pivotal role played by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) activities in\nthe global financial industry. It underscores the drawbacks of conventional AML\nsystems, which exhibit high rates of false positives and lack the\nsophistication to uncover intricate money laundering schemes. To tackle these\nchallenges, the paper proposes an advanced AML system that capitalizes on link\nanalysis using deep learning techniques. At the heart of this system lies the\nutilization of centrality algorithms like Degree Centrality, Closeness\nCentrality, Betweenness Centrality, and PageRank. These algorithms enhance the\nsystem's capability to identify suspicious activities by examining the\ninfluence and interconnections within networks of financial transactions. The\nsignificance of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts within the global financial\nsector is discussed in this paper. It highlights the limitations of traditional\nAML systems. The results showed the practicality and superiority of the new\nimplementation of the GCN model, which is a preferable method for connectively\nstructured data, meaning that a transaction or account is analyzed in the\ncontext of its financial environment. In addition, the paper delves into the\nprospects of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts, proposing the integration of\nemerging technologies such as deep learning and centrality algorithms. This\nintegration holds promise for enhancing the effectiveness of AML systems by\nrefining their capabilities."}

As an\nalternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in\nwhich a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously\nminimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme --\nin other words, being \"easy\" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL\nand design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation,\nconditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can\nbe different than the deployment environment.

Our findings show that\ncurrent LLMs struggle with robust personalization: even the strongest models\n(GPT-4.1, LLaMA3-70B) fail to maintain correctness in 5% of previously\nsuccessful cases without personalization, while smaller models (e.g., 7B-scale)\ncan fail more than 20% of the time. Further analysis reveals that robustness is\nsignificantly affected by the nature of the query and the type of user\npreference. To mitigate these failures, we propose Pref-Aligner, a two-stage\napproach that improves robustness by an average of 25% across models. Our work\nhighlights critical gaps in current evaluation practices and introduces tools\nand metrics to support more reliable, user-aligned LLM deployments."}

In this paper, we use clinical\ncontext, as captured by prior discharge summaries, to provide a more holistic\nevaluation of current ``state-of-the-art'' models for the task of CXR\ndiagnosis. Using discharge summaries recorded prior to each CXR, we derive a\n``prior'' or ``pre-test'' probability of each CXR label, as a proxy for\nexisting contextual knowledge available to clinicians when interpreting CXRs.\nUsing this measure, we demonstrate two key findings: First, for several\ndiagnostic labels, CXR models tend to perform best on cases where the pre-test\nprobability is very low, and substantially worse on cases where the pre-test\nprobability is higher. Second, we use pre-test probability to assess whether\nstrong average-case performance reflects true diagnostic signal, rather than an\nability to infer the pre-test probability as a shortcut. We find that\nperformance drops sharply on a balanced test set where this shortcut does not\nexist, which may indicate that much of the apparent diagnostic power derives\nfrom inferring this clinical context.

However, deploying\nsuch an approach for \\textit{online inference} remains challenging due to the\nlarge size of a full SMoE model and the complexity of expert routing,\nespecially in resource-constrained edge networks. Moreover, during the online\ninference, task information is often unavailable, making the task-level routing\nerror-prone. In this work, we propose a novel tree-structured adaptive neural\nbandit router, \\texttt{Tanbr}, to enable efficient and reliable online MoE\ninference. Instead of relying on explicit task tags, \\texttt{Tanbr} estimates\nthe task distribution over time from historical data and uses it to guide\ntask-aware expert merging within a given pre-trained MoE. To handle the large\ncontinuous space of merging weights, \\texttt{Tanbr} employs a binary tree to\nprogressively partition the space and generate finer candidate weights. It then\napplies a neural bandit to learn the non-linear mapping from merging weight to\nmodel performance and decides optimal expert merging. We prove that\n\\texttt{Tanbr} achieves a sublinear regret bound of {\\small\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T} \\log(T))$} over {\\small $T$} rounds, despite operating\nover a continuous decision space, matching regret bounds compared to existing\nmethods.

PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales\ninto prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we\npresent PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted\nheuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are\niteratively refined to guide prompt construction.

The reason is, as I\nwill claim, that the core technique used to train LLMs does not allow for the\nestablishment of the connection we are after. The disconnect reflects a\nfundamental limitation on the capacities of LLMs, and explains the source of\nhallucinations. I will furthermore consider the ethical version of the\ndisconnect (ethical conversational knowledge not being aligned with ethical\nconversational behaviour), since in this domain researchers have come up with\nseveral additional techniques to influence a chatbot's behaviour. I will\ndiscuss how these techniques do nothing to solve the disconnect and can make it\nworse."}

To address these challenges, we propose learnable\nsampler distillation (LSD), a novel approach to train fast and high-fidelity\nsamplers for DDMs. LSD employs a distillation approach where a student sampler\nwith a few steps learns to align its intermediate score trajectory with that of\na high-quality teacher sampler with numerous steps.

We\nidentify a core latent instability issue by scaling the computational budget of\nimplicit CoT approaches: as we increase the number of implicit reasoning tokens\nto enhance performance, the training process often becomes unstable and\ncollapses. Our analysis reveals that this instability arises from the latent\nrepresentations becoming homogeneous and losing their semantic diversity, a\nfailure caused by insufficient step-level supervision in existing implicit CoT\napproaches. To address this issue, we propose SIM-CoT, a plug-and-play training\nmodule that introduces step-level supervision to stabilize and enrich the\nlatent reasoning space. Specifically, SIM-CoT employs an auxiliary decoder\nduring training to align each implicit token with its corresponding explicit\nreasoning step, ensuring that latent states capture distinct and meaningful\ninformation. The proposed auxiliary decoder is removed during inference,\npreserving the computational efficiency of implicit CoT methods with no added\noverhead. In addition, the auxiliary decoder affords interpretability of\nimplicit reasoning by projecting each latent token onto an explicit reasoning\nvocabulary, enabling per-step visualization of semantic roles and diagnosis.\nSIM-CoT significantly enhances both the in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain\nstability of various implicit CoT methods, boosting baselines like Coconut by\n+8.2% on GPT-2 and CODI by +3.0% on LLaMA-3.1 8B.

In this perspective, we introduce\na bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM\nsystems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under\nrealistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median\nenergy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200\nbillion parameters).

Extending to test-time scaling\nscenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x\nto 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver\nthe largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the\nmodel, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median\nreductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can\nplausibly deliver 8-20x reductions.

Notably, GNNs assume an\nexisting underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not\nalways exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving\nfunctional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph\nVariate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a\nnetwork tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support\nusually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from\ngraph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs):\nlayers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent\nconnectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous,\ndata-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical\ninterdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits\nan efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across\nforecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based\nbaselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs\nand Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong\naccuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface\napplications."}

In contrast to classical generalization\ntheory, we approach this fundamental question by examining not only inputs and\noutputs, but the evolution of internal features. Our study suggests a\nphenomenon of temporal consistency that predictions remain stable when shallow\nfeatures from earlier checkpoints combine with deeper features from later ones.\nThis stability is not a trivial convergence artifact. It acts as a form of\nimplicit, structured augmentation that supports generalization. We show that\ntemporal consistency extends to unseen and corrupted data, but collapses when\nsemantic structure is destroyed (e.g., random labels). Statistical tests\nfurther reveal that SGD injects anisotropic noise aligned with a few principal\ndirections, reinforcing its role as a source of structured variability.\nTogether, these findings suggest a conceptual perspective that links feature\ndynamics to generalization, pointing toward future work on practical surrogates\nfor measuring temporal feature evolution."}

Production systems typically rely on tabular\ngradient-boosted decision trees (e.g., XGBoost) that score sessions\nindependently, overlooking the relational and temporal structure of online\nactivity that characterizes coordinated attacks and \"fraud rings.\" We introduce\nATLAS (Account Takeover Learning Across Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph), a\nframework that reformulates ATO detection as spatio-temporal node\nclassification on a time-respecting directed session graph. ATLAS links\nentities via shared identifiers (account, device, IP) and regulates\nconnectivity with time-window and recency constraints, enabling causal,\ntime-respecting message passing and latency-aware label propagation that uses\nonly labels available at scoring time, non-anticipative and leakage-free. We\noperationalize ATLAS with inductive GraphSAGE variants trained via neighbor\nsampling, at scale on a sessions graph with more than 100M nodes and around 1B\nedges.

We investigate a wide range\nof models, from classical ones such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average\nModel (ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing Model (ETS), to modern deep learning\narchitectures, including Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). We compare three\ndifferent loss function formulations that integrate a process-informed\ntrajectory prior: a fixed-weight loss, a dynamic uncertainty-based loss, and a\nResidual-Based Attention (RBA) mechanism.
