As High-Performance\nComputing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many\naccelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize\nlegacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance\nportability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos\nporting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs)\nhave shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully\nautonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains\nlargely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse\nhardware.\n  This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM \"agents\"\ncollaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize\nFortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline\nmodernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos\ncodes across hardware partitions.

While initial studies have begun to explore this paradigm, most\nfocus on analyzing code artifacts or proposing theories with limited empirical\nbacking. There remains a need for a grounded understanding of vibe coding as it\nis perceived and experienced by developers. We present the first systematic\nqualitative investigation of vibe coding perceptions and practice.

To this end, we introduce a\nbenchmarking framework, namely DBench, to host both centralized and\ndecentralized DNN training. Building upon DBench, we introduce a benchmarking\nmethodology to uncover the correlations between model accuracy and the\nvariances of parameter tensors by varying communication graphs and training\nscales. Based on the benchmarking results, we observe that, (1) Similar to\ncentralized learning, decentralized data parallel training also presents the\nissues of scalability and generality when the training scales up; (2) The model\naccuracy of decentralized learning is correlated to the number of connections\nin a communication graph; (3) The model accuracy of decentralized learning is\nsurprisingly sensitive to the variance of parameter tensors across model\nreplicas.

However, LLMs in the former\napproach struggle to handle extensive map data, while the latter shows limited\ncapability in understanding natural language preferences. Additionally, a more\ncritical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable\nspatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an\nLLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user\npreferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph\nconstruction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver\nfor optimal route finding. Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively\ntunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task\ncompletion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key\nconstraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies.

We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage\nand sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we\npropose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL\npipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching\nmechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse\nparallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance\npass rates under constrained sampling passes.

With the rise of foundation models, an open question is how they\ncompare to traditional methods for brain signal forecasting and causality\nanalysis, and whether they can be applied in a zero-shot setting. In this work,\nwe evaluate a foundation model against classical methods for inferring\ndirectional interactions from spontaneous brain activity measured with\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Traditional approaches\noften rely on Wiener-Granger causality. We tested the forecasting ability of\nthe foundation model in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and assessed\ncausality by comparing Granger-like estimates from the model with standard\nGranger causality. We validated the approach using synthetic time series\ngenerated from ground-truth causal models, including logistic map coupling and\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The foundation model achieved competitive\nzero-shot forecasting fMRI time series (mean absolute percentage error of 0.55\nin controls and 0.27 in patients).

Our method uses\nthe prediction set generated by a conformal predictor to identify\nlabel-specific uncertainty and selects the most discriminative expert using a\nsegregativity criterion, measuring how well an expert distinguishes between the\nremaining plausible labels. Experiments on CIFAR10-H and ImageNet16-H show that\nour method consistently outperforms both the standalone model and the strongest\nexpert, with accuracies attaining $99.57\\pm0.10\\%$ and $99.40\\pm0.52\\%$, while\nreducing expert workload by up to a factor of $11$. The method remains robust\nunder degraded expert performance and shows a gradual performance drop in\nlow-information settings.

We critically evaluate\npopular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that\nthey succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals,\nsuggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization\nmethods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations\noften reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated\nthem, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded.

Since synthetic data is sent to the server,\nleveraging the popular concept of dataset distillation, this FL framework\nprotects real data privacy while alleviating data heterogeneity.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Frequency-Domain aware FL method with\nhigh-energy concentration (FedFD) to address this problem. Our FedFD is\ninspired by the discovery that the discrete cosine transform predominantly\ndistributes energy to specific regions, referred to as high-energy\nconcentration. The principle behind FedFD is that low-energy like\nhigh-frequency components usually contain redundant information and noise, thus\nfiltering them helps reduce communication costs and optimize performance. Our\nFedFD is mathematically formulated to preserve the low-frequency components\nusing a binary mask, facilitating an optimal solution through frequency-domain\ndistribution alignment. In particular, real data-driven synthetic\nclassification is imposed into the loss to enhance the quality of the\nlow-frequency components. On five image and speech datasets, FedFD achieves\nsuperior performance than state-of-the-art methods while reducing communication\ncosts.

The proposed technique involves a novel\ncombination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First,\nmutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database.\nThen, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by\nmutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\nthat predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN\npredictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple\ndrug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible\ntreatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater\nthan 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing\nplayed an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating\nthat each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key\ndriver mutations, consistent with current research.

The LSTM model,\nenhanced with an attention mechanism, is used to predict sales volumes, pricing\ntrends, and spoilage rates over a seven-day period. The predictions generated\nby the LSTM model serve as inputs for the PSO algorithm, which iteratively\noptimizes pricing and replenishment strategies to maximize profitability while\nadhering to inventory constraints. The integration of cost-plus pricing allows\nfor dynamic adjustments based on fixed and variable costs, ensuring real-time\nadaptability to market fluctuations.

Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial\nrobustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes.

Our insight\nis that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as\nface recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar,\nleading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that\nseeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful\nas from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable.

By utilizing Subjective Logic to\nacquire trustworthy cross-view similarity information, TRUST-FS facilitates\nlearning a reliable similarity graph, which subsequently guides feature\nselection and imputation.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,\ncalled Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local\nlevel, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve\ngeometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate\nstructured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the\ngenerated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the\nsemantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a\nsequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning\nagent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS\nframework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack\neffectiveness and stealthiness."}

However, whether large language models (LLMs) can\naccurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of\nfoods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable\nsimpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used\n24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM\nwas prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and\nfive macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their\nquantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate\nwhether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the\nground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber\nand total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male,\nmean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean\nabsolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across\nendpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better,\nwith energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC\nexceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a\nchain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed\nsolely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values\nfrom 24-hour dietary recalls. This approach holds promise for low-burden,\ntext-based dietary monitoring tools."}

It allows\nLMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential\ncollision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes\nonly the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning\nwhen the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans\npossess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical\nenvironments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as\ninductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace\nhuman agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing\nvisual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not\ninductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual\nquestion answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.\nInPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision\nevents in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting\n13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited\nparametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive\nphysical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal\nphysical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from\nlanguage bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the\ntrustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs."}
