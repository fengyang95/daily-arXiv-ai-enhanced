While popular\nbenchmarks often provide test cases to assess the correctness of generated\ncode, crafting and executing test cases is expensive. Reference-based CEMs\nprovide a cheaper alternative by scoring a candidate program based on its\nfunctional similarity to a reference. Although prior research has focused on\nreporting the weak correlation between these CEMs and functional correctness,\nthe causes are only assumed, and plausible solutions remain unexplored. In this\nwork, we critically evaluate four state-of-the-art reference-based CEMs,\nrevealing their strong bias towards surface-level features rather than code\nfunctionality. Despite this surface bias, current evaluation datasets for these\nCEMs rarely include code pairs that are surface-similar yet functionally\ndissimilar, or functionally similar yet surface-dissimilar. To mitigate this\ngap, we propose LoCaL (Looks Can Lie), a CEM evaluation benchmark, with 3117\ncode pairs at both the method and program levels. Each pair is labeled with a\nfunctional similarity score and aims to target regions where CEMs are likely to\nperform poorly. The functional similarity scores are calculated through\ndifferential fuzzing, which eliminates the need for predefined test cases and,\nat the same time, improves the reliability of the scores by executing an order\nof magnitude more tests than prior work. We find that all four CEMs show\nsignificant performance degradation on LoCaL, compared to the baselines.\nFinally, based on our findings, we draw the implication that exposing CEMs to\nLoCaL-like data might facilitate the development of metrics that are robust to\nsurface bias."}

Because a scheming AI would deliberately try to hide its\nmisaligned goals and actions, measuring and mitigating scheming requires\ndifferent strategies than are typically used in ML. We propose that assessing\nanti-scheming interventions requires at least (1) testing propensity to scheme\non far out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, (2) evaluating whether lack of scheming\nis driven by situational awareness, and (3) checking for robustness to\npre-existing misaligned goals. We use a broad category of \"covert actions\" --\nsuch as secretly breaking rules or intentionally underperforming in tests -- as\na proxy for scheming, and design evaluations for covert actions. We then\nstress-test deliberative alignment as a case study for anti-scheming. Across 26\nOOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert\naction rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them. Our\nmitigation is also able to largely stop agents from pursuing a hidden goal\npreviously trained into the model, but we still find misbehavior after\nadditional red-teaming. We find that models' chain-of-thought (CoT) often\ndemonstrates awareness of being evaluated for alignment, and show causal\nevidence that this awareness decreases covert behavior, while unawareness\nincreases it. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the observed reductions in\ncovert action rates are at least partially driven by situational awareness.\nWhile we rely on human-legible CoT for training, studying situational\nawareness, and demonstrating clear evidence of misalignment, our ability to\nrely on this degrades as models continue to depart from reasoning in standard\nEnglish. We encourage research into alignment mitigations for scheming and\ntheir assessment, especially for the adversarial case of deceptive alignment,\nwhich this paper does not address."}

Experiments demonstrate that our framework preserves\npredictive performance on retained classes while effectively erasing forgotten\nones. Beyond utility, our method exhibits strong privacy and security\nguarantees: it is resistant to membership inference attacks, and prompt removal\nprevents any residual knowledge extraction, even under adversarial conditions.\nThis ensures compliance with data protection principles and safeguards against\nunauthorized access to forgotten information, making the framework suitable for\ndeployment in sensitive and regulated environments. Overall, by embedding\nremovability into the architecture itself, this work establishes a new\nfoundation for designing modular, scalable and ethically responsive AI models."}

We leverage knowledge graphs to\nrepresent the LLM's internal knowledge and define CU as removing the forgetting\ntarget nodes and associated edges. This graph-based formulation enables a more\nintuitive unlearning and facilitates the design of more effective methods. We\npropose a novel method that prompts the LLM to generate knowledge triplets and\nexplanatory sentences about the forgetting target and applies the unlearning\nprocess to these representations. Our approach enables more precise and\ncomprehensive concept removal by aligning the unlearning process with the LLM's\ninternal knowledge representations.

Many existing unlearning methods aim to\nsuppress undesirable outputs through additional training (e.g., gradient\nascent), which reduces the probability of generating such outputs. While such\nsuppression-based approaches can control model outputs, they may not eliminate\nthe underlying knowledge embedded in the model's internal activations; muting a\nresponse is not the same as forgetting it. Moreover, such suppression-based\nmethods often suffer from model collapse. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel unlearning method that directly intervenes in the model's internal\nactivations. In our formulation, forgetting is defined as a state in which the\nactivation of a forgotten target is indistinguishable from that of ``unknown''\nentities. Our method introduces an unlearning objective that modifies the\nactivation of the target entity away from those of known entities and toward\nthose of unknown entities in a sparse autoencoder latent space. By aligning the\ntarget's internal activation with those of unknown entities, we shift the\nmodel's recognition of the target entity from ``known'' to ``unknown'',\nachieving genuine forgetting while avoiding over-suppression and model\ncollapse. Empirically, we show that our method effectively aligns the internal\nactivations of the forgotten target, a result that the suppression-based\napproaches do not reliably achieve.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables integration\nbetween LLMs and external tools.\n  Objective: To evaluate whether an LLM connected to an EHR database via MCP\ncan autonomously retrieve clinically relevant information in a real hospital\nsetting.\n  Methods: We developed EHR-MCP, a framework of custom MCP tools integrated\nwith the hospital EHR database, and used GPT-4.1 through a LangGraph ReAct\nagent to interact with it. Six tasks were tested, derived from use cases of the\ninfection control team (ICT). Eight patients discussed at ICT conferences were\nretrospectively analyzed. Agreement with physician-generated gold standards was\nmeasured.\n  Results: The LLM consistently selected and executed the correct MCP tools.\nExcept for two tasks, all tasks achieved near-perfect accuracy.

Reliability is assessed with UAcc, an\nuncertainty-aware accuracy that rewards models for being both correct and\nconcise.

As in hardmax, uniform weights are\ndetermined by a parameter controlling neighbor influence, but the key extension\nlies in relaxing neighborhood interactions through an alignment-sensitivity\nparameter, which allows controlled deviations from pure hardmax behavior. As we\nprove, while the convex hull of the token states still converges to a convex\npolytope, its structure can no longer be fully described by a maximal alignment\nset, prompting the introduction of quiescent sets to capture the invariant\nbehavior of tokens near vertices. We show that these sets play a key role in\nunderstanding the asymptotic behavior of the system, even under time-varying\nalignment sensitivity parameters. We further show that localmax dynamics does\nnot exhibit finite-time convergence and provide results for vanishing, nonzero,\ntime-varying alignment-sensitivity parameters, recovering the limiting behavior\nof hardmax as a by-product. Finally, we adapt Lyapunov-based methods from\nclassical opinion dynamics, highlighting their limitations in the asymmetric\nsetting of localmax interactions and outlining directions for future research."}

Inspired by AST, we\nintroduce ASAC (Attention Schema-based Attention Control), which integrates the\nattention schema concept into artificial neural networks. Our initial\nexperiments focused on embedding the ASAC module within transformer\narchitectures. This module employs a Vector-Quantized Variational AutoEncoder\n(VQVAE) as both an attention abstractor and controller, facilitating precise\nattention management. By explicitly modeling attention allocation, our approach\naims to enhance system efficiency. We demonstrate ASAC's effectiveness in both\nthe vision and NLP domains, highlighting its ability to improve classification\naccuracy and expedite the learning process. Our experiments with vision\ntransformers across various datasets illustrate that the attention controller\nnot only boosts classification accuracy but also accelerates learning.\nFurthermore, we have demonstrated the model's robustness and generalization\ncapabilities across noisy and out-of-distribution datasets. In addition, we\nhave showcased improved performance in multi-task settings. Quick experiments\nreveal that the attention schema-based module enhances resilience to\nadversarial attacks, optimizes attention to improve learning efficiency, and\nfacilitates effective transfer learning and learning from fewer examples.

Validating the functional equivalence of translation and repairing, if\nnecessary, are critical steps in code translation. Existing automated\nvalidation and repair approaches struggle to generalize to many PLs due to high\nengineering overhead, and they rely on existing and often inadequate test\nsuites, which results in false claims of equivalence and ineffective\ntranslation repair. We develop MatchFixAgent, a large language model\n(LLM)-based, PL-agnostic framework for equivalence validation and repair of\ntranslations. MatchFixAgent features a multi-agent architecture that divides\nequivalence validation into several sub-tasks to ensure thorough and consistent\nsemantic analysis of the translation. Then it feeds this analysis to test agent\nto write and execute tests. Upon observing a test failure, the repair agent\nattempts to fix the translation bug. The final (in)equivalence decision is made\nby the verdict agent, considering semantic analyses and test execution results.\n  We compare MatchFixAgent's validation and repair results with four\nrepository-level code translation techniques. We use 2,219 translation pairs\nfrom their artifacts, which cover 6 PL pairs, and are collected from 24 GitHub\nprojects totaling over 900K lines of code. Our results demonstrate that\nMatchFixAgent produces (in)equivalence verdicts for 99.2% of translation pairs,\nwith the same equivalence validation result as prior work on 72.8% of them.\nWhen MatchFixAgent's result disagrees with prior work, we find that 60.7% of\nthe time MatchFixAgent's result is actually correct. In addition, we show that\nMatchFixAgent can repair 50.6% of inequivalent translation, compared to prior\nwork's 18.5%. This demonstrates that MatchFixAgent is far more adaptable to\nmany PL pairs than prior work, while producing highly accurate validation\nresults."}
