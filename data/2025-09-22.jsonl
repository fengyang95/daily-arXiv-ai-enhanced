However,\ntheir static deployment conflicts with growing societal and regulatory demands\n-- particularly the need to unlearn specific data upon request, as mandated by\nprivacy frameworks such as the GDPR. Traditional unlearning approaches,\nincluding retraining, activation editing, or distillation, are often\ncomputationally expensive, fragile, and ill-suited for real-time or\ncontinuously evolving systems. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift:\nrethinking unlearning not as a retroactive intervention but as a built-in\ncapability. We introduce a prompt-based learning framework that unifies\nknowledge acquisition and removal within a single training phase. Rather than\nencoding information in model weights, our approach binds class-level semantics\nto dedicated prompt tokens. This design enables instant unlearning simply by\nremoving the corresponding prompt -- without retraining, model modification, or\naccess to original data. Experiments demonstrate that our framework preserves\npredictive performance on retained classes while effectively erasing forgotten\nones. Beyond utility, our method exhibits strong privacy and security\nguarantees: it is resistant to membership inference attacks, and prompt removal\nprevents any residual knowledge extraction, even under adversarial conditions.\nThis ensures compliance with data protection principles and safeguards against\nunauthorized access to forgotten information, making the framework suitable for\ndeployment in sensitive and regulated environments. Overall, by embedding\nremovability into the architecture itself, this work establishes a new\nfoundation for designing modular, scalable and ethically responsive AI models."}

While popular\nbenchmarks often provide test cases to assess the correctness of generated\ncode, crafting and executing test cases is expensive. Reference-based CEMs\nprovide a cheaper alternative by scoring a candidate program based on its\nfunctional similarity to a reference. Although prior research has focused on\nreporting the weak correlation between these CEMs and functional correctness,\nthe causes are only assumed, and plausible solutions remain unexplored. In this\nwork, we critically evaluate four state-of-the-art reference-based CEMs,\nrevealing their strong bias towards surface-level features rather than code\nfunctionality. Despite this surface bias, current evaluation datasets for these\nCEMs rarely include code pairs that are surface-similar yet functionally\ndissimilar, or functionally similar yet surface-dissimilar. To mitigate this\ngap, we propose LoCaL (Looks Can Lie), a CEM evaluation benchmark, with 3117\ncode pairs at both the method and program levels. Each pair is labeled with a\nfunctional similarity score and aims to target regions where CEMs are likely to\nperform poorly. The functional similarity scores are calculated through\ndifferential fuzzing, which eliminates the need for predefined test cases and,\nat the same time, improves the reliability of the scores by executing an order\nof magnitude more tests than prior work. We find that all four CEMs show\nsignificant performance degradation on LoCaL, compared to the baselines.\nFinally, based on our findings, we draw the implication that exposing CEMs to\nLoCaL-like data might facilitate the development of metrics that are robust to\nsurface bias."}

First, our\nReasoning-Oriented Data Strategy (RODS) combines curated medical QA datasets\nwith knowledge-graph-guided synthesis to improve coverage of underrepresented\ndiseases, drugs, and multi-hop reasoning chains. Second, we employ\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) cold start to distill high-quality reasoning\ntrajectories from teacher models, establishing robust inference priors. Third,\nwe implement a two-stage Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)\nframework using Group Relative Policy Optimization, which consolidates core\nreasoning skills while targeting persistent failure modes through adaptive\nhard-sample mining. Across diverse medical benchmarks, Fleming-R1 delivers\nsubstantial parameter-efficient improvements: the 7B variant surpasses much\nlarger baselines, while the 32B model achieves near-parity with GPT-4o and\nconsistently outperforms strong open-source alternatives. These results\ndemonstrate that structured data design, reasoning-oriented initialization, and\nverifiable reinforcement learning can advance clinical reasoning beyond simple\naccuracy optimization.

Across 26\nOOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert\naction rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them.

While\nvarious algorithms have been proposed, existing methods and analyses lack\nadaptivity in stochastic optimization settings: they cannot achieve optimal\nconvergence rates across a wide spectrum of gradient noise levels without prior\nknowledge of the noise magnitude. In this paper, we propose novel adaptive\nalgorithms for two important classes of stochastic hierarchical optimization\nproblems: nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization and\nnonconvex-strongly-convex bilevel optimization. Our algorithms achieve sharp\nconvergence rates of $\\widetilde{O}(1/\\sqrt{T} + \\sqrt{\\bar{\\sigma}}/T^{1/4})$\nin $T$ iterations for the gradient norm, where $\\bar{\\sigma}$ is an upper bound\non the stochastic gradient noise.

Many existing unlearning methods aim to\nsuppress undesirable outputs through additional training (e.g., gradient\nascent), which reduces the probability of generating such outputs.

To address these limitations, we propose\nPolyJuice, the first black-box, image-agnostic red-teaming method for SIDs,\nbased on an observed distribution shift in the T2I latent space between samples\ncorrectly and incorrectly classified by the SID.

The prevalent single-query approach is simple, but\nsuffers from high estimation variance, motivating a multi-query paradigm to\nimproves estimation accuracy. This, however, creates a critical trade-off:\nunder a fixed budget of queries (i.e. cost), queries per iteration and the\ntotal number of optimization iterations are inversely proportional to one\nanother. How to best allocate this budget is a fundamental, under-explored\nquestion.\n  This work systematically resolves this query allocation problem. We analyze\ntwo aggregation methods: the de facto simple averaging (ZO-Avg), and a new\nProjection Alignment method (ZO-Align) we derive from local surrogate\nminimization. By deriving convergence rates for both methods that make the\ndependence on the number of queries explicit across strongly convex, convex,\nnon-convex, and stochastic settings, we uncover a stark dichotomy: For ZO-Avg,\nwe prove that using more than one query per iteration is always\nquery-inefficient, rendering the single-query approach optimal. On the\ncontrary, ZO-Align generally performs better with more queries per iteration,\nresulting in a full-subspace estimation as the optimal approach.

We\ndemonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN\ncan enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA\nRectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without\nmodifying the training objective.

In\nthis work, we study this problem of example selection in ICL from a principled,\ninformation theory-driven perspective. We first model an LLM as a linear\nfunction over input embeddings and frame the example selection task as a\nquery-specific optimization problem: selecting a subset of exemplars from a\nlarger example bank that minimizes the prediction error on a specific query.\nThis formulation departs from traditional generalization-focused learning\ntheoretic approaches by targeting accurate prediction for a specific query\ninstance.

To\ntackle these problems, we introduce ReaSyn, a generative framework for\nsynthesizable projection where the model explores the neighborhood of given\nmolecules in the synthesizable space by generating pathways that result in\nsynthesizable analogs. To fully utilize the chemical knowledge contained in the\nsynthetic pathways, we propose a novel perspective that views synthetic\npathways akin to reasoning paths in large language models (LLMs). Specifically,\ninspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs, we introduce the\nchain-of-reaction (CoR) notation that explicitly states reactants, reaction\ntypes, and intermediate products for each step in a pathway. With the CoR\nnotation, ReaSyn can get dense supervision in every reaction step to explicitly\nlearn chemical reaction rules during supervised training and perform\nstep-by-step reasoning. In addition, to further enhance the reasoning\ncapability of ReaSyn, we propose reinforcement learning (RL)-based finetuning\nand goal-directed test-time compute scaling tailored for synthesizable\nprojection. ReaSyn achieves the highest reconstruction rate and pathway\ndiversity in synthesizable molecule reconstruction and the highest optimization\nperformance in synthesizable goal-directed molecular optimization, and\nsignificantly outperforms previous synthesizable projection methods in\nsynthesizable hit expansion. These results highlight ReaSyn's superior ability\nto navigate combinatorially-large synthesizable chemical space."}

While RS is well understood for\nclassification, its application to generative models is unclear, since their\noutputs are sequences rather than labels. We resolve this by connecting\ngenerative outputs to an oracle classification task and showing that RS can\nstill be enabled: the final response can be classified as a discrete action\n(e.g., service-robot commands in VLAs), as harmful vs. harmless (content\nmoderation or toxicity detection in VLMs), or even applying oracles to cluster\nanswers into semantically equivalent ones. Provided that the error rate for the\noracle classifier comparison is bounded, we develop the theory that associates\nthe number of samples with the corresponding robustness radius. We further\nderive improved scaling laws analytically relating the certified radius and\naccuracy to the number of samples, showing that the earlier result of 2 to 3\norders of magnitude fewer samples sufficing with minimal loss remains valid\neven under weaker assumptions.

In this work, we challeng this static paradigm by introducing a\nframework for dynamic CFG scheduling. Our method leverages online feedback from\na suite of general-purpose and specialized small-scale latent-space\nevaluations, such as CLIP for alignment, a discriminator for fidelity and a\nhuman preference reward model, to assess generation quality at each step of the\nreverse diffusion process. Based on this feedback, we perform a greedy search\nto select the optimal CFG scale for each timestep, creating a unique guidance\nschedule tailored to every prompt and sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our approach on both small-scale models and the state-of-the-art Imagen 3,\nshowing significant improvements in text alignment, visual quality, text\nrendering and numerical reasoning. Notably, when compared against the default\nImagen 3 baseline, our method achieves up to 53.8% human preference win-rate\nfor overall preference, a figure that increases up to to 55.5% on prompts\ntargeting specific capabilities like text rendering.

Trained on high-fidelity hydrocode data, MSTM runs\nabout a thousand times faster than direct simulation, achieving errors below\n4\\% in porous materials and below 10\\% in lattice structures.

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and\nits variants are widely used to train deep neural networks. In contrast to\ntraditional approaches that focus on tuning the learning rate, we propose a\nnovel adaptive batch size SGD algorithm, DiveBatch, that dynamically adjusts\nthe batch size. Adapting the batch size is challenging: using large batch sizes\nis more efficient due to parallel computation, but small-batch training often\nconverges in fewer epochs and generalizes better. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce a data-driven adaptation based on gradient diversity, enabling\nDiveBatch to maintain the generalization performance of small-batch training\nwhile improving convergence speed and computational efficiency. Gradient\ndiversity has a strong theoretical justification: it emerges from the\nconvergence analysis of SGD. Evaluations of DiveBatch on synthetic and\nCiFar-10, CiFar-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that DiveBatch converges\nsignificantly faster than standard SGD and AdaBatch (1.06 -- 5.0x), with a\nslight trade-off in performance."}

Second,\nthere are ~30,000^k k-tuples to consider, k the token-length of a putative\ntrigger. Third, for LLMs there is the need to blacklist tokens that have strong\nmarginal associations with the putative target response (class) of an attack,\nas such tokens give false detection signals. However, good blacklists may not\nexist for some domains. We propose a LLM trigger inversion approach with three\nkey components: i) discrete search, with putative triggers greedily accreted,\nstarting from a select list of singletons; ii) implicit blacklisting, achieved\nby evaluating the average cosine similarity, in activation space, between a\ncandidate trigger and a small clean set of samples from the putative target\nclass; iii) detection when a candidate trigger elicits high misclassifications,\nand with unusually high decision confidence. Unlike many recent works, we\ndemonstrate that our approach reliably detects and successfully inverts\nground-truth backdoor trigger phrases."}
