The theoretical foundation rests on\nPeirce's semiotics, particularly the interplay between representamen, object,\nand interpretant, and the typological richness of signs: qualisign, sinsign,\nlegisign; icon, index, symbol; rheme, dicent, argument - alongside the\ninterpretant triad captured in the Dynacom model. Analytically, the paper\npositions the LLM as a semiotic resource that generates interpretants in\nresponse to user prompts, thereby participating in meaning-making within shared\nuniverses of discourse. The findings suggest that prompting is a semiotic and\ncommunicative process that redefines how knowledge is organized, searched,\ninterpreted, and co-constructed in digital environments.

We argue that current\nperformance-based definitions are inadequate because they provide no clear,\nmechanism-focused roadmap for research, and they fail to properly define the\nqualitative nature of genuine intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the human\nbrain, we propose a new paradigm that shifts the focus from external mimicry to\nthe development of foundational cognitive architectures. We define True\nIntelligence (TI) as a system characterized by six core components: embodied\nsensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata creation, a\nhighly-interconnected multi-expert architecture, an orchestration layer, and\nlastly, the unmeasurable quality of Interconnectedness, which we hypothesize\nresults in consciousness and a subjective experience. We propose a practical,\nfive-level taxonomy of AGI based on the number of the first five measurable\ncomponents a system exhibits. This framework provides a clear path forward with\ndevelopmental milestones that directly address the challenge of building\ngenuinely intelligent systems. We contend that once a system achieves Level-5\nAGI by implementing all five measurable components, the difference between it\nand TI remains as a purely philosophical debate. For practical purposes - and\ngiven theories indicate consciousness is an emergent byproduct of integrated,\nhigher-order cognition - we conclude that a fifth-level AGI is functionally and\npractically equivalent to TI.

In this work, we propose BEACON, a\nnovel deep learning framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to\ngenerate dense, contextual embeddings from raw sandbox-generated behavior\nreports. These embeddings capture semantic and structural patterns of each\nsample and are processed by a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D\nCNN) for multi-class malware classification. Evaluated on the Avast-CTU Public\nCAPE Dataset, our framework consistently outperforms existing methods,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based behavioral embeddings and the\noverall design of BEACON for robust malware classification."}

However,\nexisting LMDM formulations are limited to vectorized inputs and struggle with\nhigh-dimensional tensor data due to the need for flattening, which destroys the\ndata's inherent multi-mode structure and increases computational burden. In\nthis paper, we propose a Structure-Preserving Margin Distribution Learning for\nHigh-Order Tensor Data with Low-Rank Decomposition (SPMD-LRT) that operates\ndirectly on tensor representations without vectorization. The SPMD-LRT\npreserves multi-dimensional spatial structure by incorporating first-order and\nsecond-order tensor statistics (margin mean and variance) into the objective,\nand it leverages low-rank tensor decomposition techniques including rank-1(CP),\nhigher-rank CP, and Tucker decomposition to parameterize the weight tensor. An\nalternating optimization (double-gradient descent) algorithm is developed to\nefficiently solve the SPMD-LRT, iteratively updating factor matrices and core\ntensor. This approach enables SPMD-LRT to maintain the structural information\nof high-order data while optimizing margin distribution for improved\nclassification. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets (including MNIST,\nimages and fMRI neuroimaging) demonstrate that SPMD-LRT achieves superior\nclassification accuracy compared to conventional SVM, vector-based LMDM, and\nprior tensor-based SVM extensions (Support Tensor Machines and Support Tucker\nMachines). Notably, SPMD-LRT with Tucker decomposition attains the highest\naccuracy, highlighting the benefit of structure preservation. These results\nconfirm the effectiveness and robustness of SPMD-LRT in handling\nhigh-dimensional tensor data for classification."}

Personal style is often\nsubtle and implicit, making it difficult to specify through prompts yet\nessential for user-aligned generation. This work presents a comprehensive\nevaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs' ability to mimic personal writing styles\nvia in-context learning from a small number of user-authored samples. We\nintroduce an ensemble of complementary metrics-including authorship\nattribution, authorship verification, style matching, and AI detection-to\nrobustly assess style imitation. Our evaluation spans over 40000 generations\nper model across domains such as news, email, forums, and blogs, covering\nwriting samples from more than 400 real-world authors. Results show that while\nLLMs can approximate user styles in structured formats like news and email,\nthey struggle with nuanced, informal writing in blogs and forums.

Moreover, this process\ntypically relies on the physicist's intuition and expertise, as no systematic\nmethod exists.\n  This paper has two primary goals. First, from a particle physics perspective,\nwe present a novel approach that utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to\novercome the aforementioned challenges by systematically determining the\ncritical backgrounds affecting beauty hadron decay measurements. While beauty\nhadron physics serves as the case study in this work, the proposed strategy is\nbroadly adaptable to other types of particle physics measurements. Second, from\na Machine Learning perspective, we introduce a novel algorithm which exploits\nthe synergy between RL and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for environments with\nhighly sparse rewards and a large trajectory space. This strategy leverages GAs\nto efficiently explore the trajectory space and identify successful\ntrajectories, which are used to guide the RL agent's training. Our method also\nincorporates a transformer architecture for the RL agent to handle token\nsequences representing decays."}

Moreover, while prior\nwork shows that LLM-based rerankers improve CLIR performance, their evaluation\nsetup relies on lexical retrieval with machine translation (MT) for the first\nstage. This is not only prohibitively expensive but also prone to error\npropagation across stages. Our evaluation on passage-level and document-level\nCLIR reveals that further gains can be achieved with multilingual bi-encoders\nas first-stage retrievers and that the benefits of translation diminishes with\nstronger reranking models. We further show that pairwise rerankers based on\ninstruction-tuned LLMs perform competitively with listwise rerankers. To the\nbest of our knowledge, we are the first to study the interaction between\nretrievers and rerankers in two-stage CLIR with LLMs. Our findings reveal that,\nwithout MT, current state-of-the-art rerankers fall severely short when\ndirectly applied in CLIR."}

In this paper, we propose an OpenRE\nframework based on large language models (LLMs), which directly predicts new\nrelations for test instances by leveraging their strong language understanding\nand generation abilities, without human intervention. Specifically, our\nframework consists of two core components: (1) a relation discoverer (RD),\ndesigned to predict new relations for test instances based on\n\\textit{demonstrations} formed by training instances with known relations; and\n(2) a relation predictor (RP), used to select the most likely relation for a\ntest instance from $n$ candidate relations, guided by \\textit{demonstrations}\ncomposed of their instances. To enhance the ability of our framework to predict\nnew relations, we design a self-correcting inference strategy composed of three\nstages: relation discovery, relation denoising, and relation prediction. In the\nfirst stage, we use RD to preliminarily predict new relations for all test\ninstances. Next, we apply RP to select some high-reliability test instances for\neach new relation from the prediction results of RD through a cross-validation\nmethod. During the third stage, we employ RP to re-predict the relations of all\ntest instances based on the demonstrations constructed from these reliable test\ninstances. Extensive experiments on three OpenRE datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework. We release our code at\nhttps://github.com/XMUDeepLIT/LLM-OREF.git."}

Evaluated on four competitive LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5\nSonnet, DeepSeek V3, and Perplexity Sonar), CARGO achieves a top-1 routing\naccuracy of 76.4% and win rates ranging from 72% to 89% against individual\nexperts. These results demonstrate that confidence-guided, lightweight routing\ncan achieve expert-level performance with minimal overhead, offering a\npractical solution for real-world, multi-model LLM deployments."}

Prior approaches to\npatent NLP have primarily relied on fine-tuning general-purpose models or\ndomain-adapted variants pretrained with limited data. In this work, we pretrain\n3 domain-specific masked language models for patents, using the ModernBERT\narchitecture and a curated corpus of over 60 million patent records. Our\napproach incorporates architectural optimizations, including FlashAttention,\nrotary embeddings, and GLU feed-forward layers. We evaluate our models on four\ndownstream patent classification tasks. Our model, ModernBERT-base-PT,\nconsistently outperforms the general-purpose ModernBERT baseline on three out\nof four datasets and achieves competitive performance with a baseline\nPatentBERT. Additional experiments with ModernBERT-base-VX and\nMosaic-BERT-large demonstrate that scaling the model size and customizing the\ntokenizer further enhance performance on selected tasks. Notably, all\nModernBERT variants retain substantially faster inference over - 3x that of\nPatentBERT - underscoring their suitability for time-sensitive applications.\nThese results underscore the benefits of domain-specific pretraining and\narchitectural improvements for patent-focused NLP tasks."}

However, predictive modeling of\npreviously highlighted CPE-associated risks such as readmission, mortality, and\nextended length of stay (LOS) remains underexplored, particularly with modern\ndeep learning approaches. This study introduces an eXplainable AI modeling\nframework to investigate CPE impact on patient outcomes from Electronic Medical\nRecords data of an Irish hospital. We analyzed an inpatient dataset from an\nIrish acute hospital, incorporating diagnostic codes, ward transitions, patient\ndemographics, infection-related variables and contact network features. Several\nTransformer-based architectures were benchmarked alongside traditional machine\nlearning models. Clinical outcomes were predicted, and XAI techniques were\napplied to interpret model decisions. Our framework successfully demonstrated\nthe utility of Transformer-based models, with TabTransformer consistently\noutperforming baselines across multiple clinical prediction tasks, especially\nfor CPE acquisition (AUROC and sensitivity). We found infection-related\nfeatures, including historical hospital exposure, admission context, and\nnetwork centrality measures, to be highly influential in predicting patient\noutcomes and CPE acquisition risk. Explainability analyses revealed that\nfeatures like \"Area of Residence\", \"Admission Ward\" and prior admissions are\nkey risk factors. Network variables like \"Ward PageRank\" also ranked highly,\nreflecting the potential value of structural exposure information. This study\npresents a robust and explainable AI framework for analyzing complex EMR data\nto identify key risk factors and predict CPE-related outcomes. Our findings\nunderscore the superior performance of the Transformer models and highlight the\nimportance of diverse clinical and network features."}

Diffusion-based language models offer a promising\nalternative, as they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, we\nidentify a key bottleneck in current diffusion LMs: the long decoding-window\nproblem, where tokens generated far from the input context often become\nirrelevant or repetitive. Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address\nthis issue by splitting windows into blocks, but this sacrifices speed and\nbidirectionality, eliminating the main advantage of diffusion models. To\novercome this, we propose Convolutional decoding (Conv), a normalization-based\nmethod that narrows the decoding window without hard segmentation, leading to\nbetter fluency and flexibility. Additionally, we introduce Rejecting Rule-based\nFine-Tuning (R2FT), a post-hoc training scheme that better aligns tokens at\npositions far from context. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on\nopen-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval) among diffusion LM\nbaselines, with significantly lower step size than previous works,\ndemonstrating both speed and quality improvements."}

Despite recent advancements, these models\nstill struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from\nthe lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric\nimages. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically\nfail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this\npaper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of\nReinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation\npipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized\nfrom 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from\nmathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key\nfeatures of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization\nand yields non-trivial improvements.
