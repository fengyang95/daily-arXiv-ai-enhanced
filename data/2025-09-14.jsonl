We present a framework that\nintegrates an active Pareto front learning algorithm (PyePAL) with\nvisualization and explainable AI techniques to optimize processing parameters.\nPyePAL uses Gaussian process models to predict objective values (hardness and\nelasticity) from the design variables (spin speed, dilution, and polymer\nmixture), guiding the adaptive selection of samples toward promising regions of\nthe design space. To enable interpretable insights into the high-dimensional\ndesign space, we utilize UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)\nfor two-dimensional visualization of the Pareto front exploration.\nAdditionally, we incorporate fuzzy linguistic summaries, which translate the\nlearned relationships between process parameters and performance objectives\ninto linguistic statements, thus enhancing the explainability and understanding\nof the optimization results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nefficiently identifies promising polymer designs, while the visual and\nlinguistic explanations facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge\ndiscovery."}

Geostatistics leverages\nthe spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the\nrelationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We\npropose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through\nengineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this\napproach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of\nregression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and\nprobabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six\nfieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,\nclay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and\nin-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable\nuncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several\nother spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as\nwell as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random\nforest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30%\ncompared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This\nimprovement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN\nalgorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR\nfeatures. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small\nsample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for\nweak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal\nsoil sensing data are limited.

Quantization reduces memory through lower\nnumerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic\nperformance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as\nQuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before\nquantization, using computational invariance: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{Wx} =\n(\\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\\mathbf{Q}$. However, these\nmethods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case\ncoherence $\\mu = 1/\\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight\ndistributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct\noutlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than\none-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces\nHadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by\ncontinuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\\{+1, -1\\}$\nentries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,\nbutterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization\nwhile guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint\nensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \\log\nn)$ computational complexity with only $\\frac{n \\log n}{2}$ learnable\nparameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on\npost-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to\nquantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in\nminutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit\nquantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot."}
