Two genetic\nalgorithm-based code generators were developed to produce two distinct types of\ncode: (i) independent loops, which are parallelizable, and (ii) ambiguous\nloops, whose dependencies are unclear, making them impossible to define if the\nloop is parallelizable or not. The generated code snippets were tokenized and\npreprocessed to ensure a robust dataset. Two deep learning models - a Deep\nNeural Network (DNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - were\nimplemented to perform the classification. Based on 30 independent runs, a\nrobust statistical analysis was employed to verify the expected performance of\nboth models, DNN and CNN. The CNN showed a slightly higher mean performance,\nbut the two models had a similar variability. Experiments with varying dataset\nsizes highlighted the importance of data diversity for model performance. These\nresults demonstrate the feasibility of using deep learning to automate the\nidentification of parallelizable structures in code, offering a promising tool\nfor software optimization and performance improvement."}

For predicting Difference from Target (DFT)\nvalues, we test deterministic and probabilistic machine learning methods.\nDeterministic models, trained on 80% of the dataset, provide precise point\nestimates, with Support Vector Regression (SVR) achieving accuracy close to\nprocess repeatability. To address systematic deviations, we adopt Gaussian\nProcess Regression (GPR) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs).

We investigate two BNN approaches: one\nbalancing accuracy and uncertainty capture, and another offering richer\nuncertainty decomposition but with lower dimensional accuracy.

One of the most\ncommon tools used to check if everything is working properly is called\nStatistical Process Control (SPC). Traditional SPC methods work by checking\nwhether recent measurements are within acceptable limits. However, they only\nreact after a problem has already occurred. This can lead to wasted materials,\nmachine downtime, and increased costs. In this paper, we present a smarter way\nto use SPC. Instead of just reacting to issues after they happen, our system\ncan predict future problems before they occur. We use a machine learning tool\ncalled Facebook Prophet, which is designed to work with time-series data (data\nthat changes over time). Prophet looks at past data and forecasts what the next\nvalue will be. Then, we use SPC rules to decide if the predicted value is in a\nSafe zone (no problem), a Warning zone (needs attention), or a Critical zone\n(may require shutting down the process). We applied this system to real data\nfrom a semiconductor manufacturing company. One of the challenges with this\ndata is that the measurements are not taken at regular time intervals. This\nmakes it harder to predict future values accurately. Despite this, our model\nwas able to make strong predictions and correctly classify the risk level of\nfuture measurements. The main benefit of our system is that it gives engineers\nand technicians a chance to act early - before something goes wrong. This helps\nreduce unexpected failures and improves the overall stability and reliability\nof the production process. By combining machine learning with traditional SPC,\nwe make quality control more proactive, accurate, and useful for modern\nindustry."}

We validate our theory empirically:\nCLEVR models that succeed at length generalization exhibit local conditional\nscores, while those that fail do not. Furthermore, we show that a causal\nintervention explicitly enforcing local conditional scores restores length\ngeneralization in a previously failing model. Finally, we investigate\nfeature-space compositionality in color-conditioned CLEVR, and find preliminary\nevidence of compositional structure in SDXL."}

We introduce CLOTHO, a\ntask-specific, pre-generation adequacy measure that estimates input difficulty\ndirectly from hidden LLM states. Given a large pool of unlabelled inputs for a\nspecific task, CLOTHO uses a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to adaptively sample\nthe most informative cases for human labelling.

This paper identifies a transition from\ngeneralization to memorization during model collapse in diffusion models, where\nmodels increasingly replicate training data instead of generating novel content\nduring iterative training on synthetic samples. This transition is directly\ndriven by the declining entropy of the synthetic training data produced in each\ntraining cycle, which serves as a clear indicator of model degradation.\nMotivated by this insight, we propose an entropy-based data selection strategy\nto mitigate the transition from generalization to memorization and alleviate\nmodel collapse.

However, when a specification is violated,\nsuch a verdict is often insufficient to understand why the violation happened.\nTo fill this gap, diagnostics approaches aim to produce more informative\nverdicts. In this paper, we address the problem of generating informative\nverdicts for violated Inter-procedural Control-Flow Temporal Logic (iCFTL)\nspecifications that express constraints over program variable values. We\npropose a diagnostic approach based on backward data-flow analysis to\nstatically determine the relevant statements contributing to the specification\nviolation.

To address these shortcomings, we investigate three key\nquestions: the stability of neuron-level toxicity indicators, the advantages of\nstructural (layer-wise) representations, and the interpretability of mechanisms\ndriving toxic generation. Through extensive experiments on Jigsaw and ToxiCN\ndatasets, we show that aggregated layer-wise features provide more robust\nsignals than single neurons.

PTQTP achieves multiplication-free inference, identical to\n1-bit quantization, while maintaining superior expressiveness through its novel\nstructured decomposition. Our approach provides: (1) a theoretically grounded\nprogressive approximation algorithm ensuring global weight consistency; (2)\nmodel-agnostic deployment across diverse modern LLMs without architectural\nmodifications; and (3) uniform ternary operations that eliminate the need for\nmixed-precision or compensation schemes. Comprehensive experiments across\nLLaMA3.x and Qwen3 model families (0.6B-70B parameters) demonstrate that PTQTP\nsignificantly outperforms existing low-bit PTQ methods, achieving 82.4%\nmathematical reasoning retention versus 0% for competing approaches. PTQTP\napproaches and sometimes surpasses 1.58-bit quantization-aware training\nperformance while requiring only single-hour quantization compared to 10-14 GPU\ndays for training-based methods. These results establish PTQTP as a practical\nsolution for efficient LLM deployment in resource-constrained environments."}

Our primary contribution is\ndemonstrating that the difficulty of non-tabular environments is dominated by a\nfactor that tabular metrics ignore: representation hardness. The same\nunderlying MDP can pose vastly different challenges depending on whether the\nagent receives state vectors or pixel-based observations. To enable this\nanalysis, we introduce \\texttt{pharos}, a new open-source library for\nprincipled RL benchmarking that allows for systematic control over both\nenvironment structure and agent representations. Our extensive case study using\n\\texttt{pharos} shows that while tabular metrics offer some insight, they are\npoor predictors of deep RL agent performance on their own. This work highlights\nthe urgent need for new, representation-aware hardness measures and positions\n\\texttt{pharos} as a key tool for developing them."}

One major prediction of such models is that\nthe quality of the bottom-up inputs modulates ease of processing -- noisy\ninputs should lead to difficult and effortful comprehension. We test this\nprediction in the domain of reading. First, we propose an information-theoretic\noperationalization for the \"quality\" of bottom-up information as the mutual\ninformation (MI) between visual information and word identity. We formalize\nthis prediction in a mathematical model of reading as a Bayesian update.\nSecond, we test our operationalization by comparing participants' reading times\nin conditions where words' information quality has been reduced, either by\noccluding their top or bottom half, with full words. We collect data in English\nand Chinese. We then use multimodal language models to estimate the mutual\ninformation between visual inputs and words. We use these data to estimate the\nspecific effect of reduced information quality on reading times. Finally, we\ncompare how information is distributed across visual forms. In English and\nChinese, the upper half contains more information about word identity than the\nlower half.

It actively defends its cherished beliefs even in the\nface of contradictory evidence, conveniently interprets information to conform\nto desired narratives, and selectively searches for or avoids information to\nsuit its various purposes. Despite these behaviours deviating from common\nnormative standards for belief updating, we argue that such 'biases' are not\ninherently cognitive flaws, but rather an adaptive response to the significant\npragmatic and cognitive costs associated with revising one's beliefs. This\npaper introduces a formal framework that aims to model the influence of these\ncosts on our belief updating mechanisms.\n  We treat belief updating as a motivated variational decision, where agents\nweigh the perceived 'utility' of a belief against the informational cost\nrequired to adopt a new belief state, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence from the prior to the variational posterior. We perform\ncomputational experiments to demonstrate that simple instantiations of this\nresource-rational model can be used to qualitatively emulate commonplace human\nbehaviours, including confirmation bias and attitude polarisation.

In\nthis work we present a new approach to constraint satisfaction and optimization\nin dynamically changing environments, particularly when variables in the\nproblem are statistically independent. We frame it as a reinforcement learning\nproblem and introduce a conditional policy generator by borrowing the idea of\nclass conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). Assuming that the\nproblem includes both static and dynamic constraints, the former are used in a\nreward formulation to guide the policy training such that it learns to map to a\nprobabilistic distribution of solutions satisfying static constraints from a\nnoise prior, which is similar to a generator in GANs. On the other hand,\ndynamic constraints in the problem are encoded to different class labels and\nfed with the input noise. The policy is then simultaneously updated for maximum\nlikelihood of correctly classifying given the dynamic conditions in a\nsupervised manner. We empirically demonstrate a proof-of-principle experiment\nwith a multi-modal constraint satisfaction problem and compare between\nunconditional and conditional cases."}

Compared to traditional ML with\nfixed data, designing algorithms in PP converging to a stable point -- known as\na stationary performative stable (SPS) solution -- is more challenging than the\ncounterpart in conventional ML tasks due to the model-induced distribution\nshifts. While considerable efforts have been made to find SPS solutions using\nmethods such as repeated gradient descent (RGD) and greedy stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD-GD), most prior studies assumed a strongly convex loss until a\nrecent work established $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence of SGD-GD to SPS\nsolutions under smooth, non-convex losses. However, this latest progress is\nstill based on the restricted bounded variance assumption in stochastic\ngradient estimates and yields convergence bounds with a non-vanishing error\nneighborhood that scales with the variance. This limitation motivates us to\nimprove convergence rates and reduce error in stochastic optimization for PP,\nparticularly in non-convex settings. Thus, we propose a new algorithm called\nstochastic performative prediction with variance reduction (SPRINT) and\nestablish its convergence to an SPS solution at a rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/T)$.\nNotably, the resulting error neighborhood is **independent** of the variance of\nthe stochastic gradients.

Our findings reveal a modest performance drop in GPT-4.1 due to rubric\nmismatches and a significant failure in the Japanese-native model, which lacked\nthe required clinical completeness. Furthermore, our classification indicates\nthat while the majority of scenarios are applicable, a substantial portion of\nthe rubric criteria requires localization. This work underscores the\nlimitations of direct benchmark translation and highlights the urgent need for\na context-aware, localized adaptation, a J-HealthBench, to ensure the reliable\nand safe evaluation of medical LLMs in Japan."}

Recently, deep learning architectures have made a\nmajor breakthrough in forecasting the daily average temperature over a ten-day\nhorizon.

A problem\nthat is even more complex consists in making predictions of the maximum daily\ntemperatures in the short, medium, and long term. In this work, we focus on\nforecasting events related to the maximum daily temperature over medium-term\nperiods (90 days). Therefore, instead of addressing the problem from a\nmeteorological point of view, this article tackles it from a climatological\npoint of view. Due to the complexity of this problem, a common approach is to\nframe the study as a temporal classification problem with the classes: maximum\ntemperature \"above normal\", \"normal\" or \"below normal\". From a practical point\nof view, we created a large historical dataset (from 1981 to 2018) collecting\ninformation from weather stations located in South America. In addition, we\nalso integrated exogenous information from the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian\nOcean basins. We applied the AutoGluonTS platform to solve the above-mentioned\nproblem.

A Case Study with In-Context Representation Learning", "comment": "NIPS 2025", "summary": "The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be enhanced\nwith test-time computation, which relies on external tools and even other deep\nlearning models. However, existing approaches for integrating non-text modality\nrepresentations into LLMs typically require additional costly supervised\ntraining, restricting on-the-fly adaptation to new domains and modalities. In\nthis work, we explore the feasibility of integrating representations from\nnon-text foundational models (FMs) into text-based LLMs in a training-free\nmanner. We propose In-Context Representation Learning (ICRL) as a\nproof-of-concept to allow LLMs to adaptively utilize non-text modality\nrepresentations with few-shot learning. Unlike traditional in-context learning,\nwhich incorporates text-label pairs, ICRL replaces text inputs with FM\nrepresentations, enabling the LLM to perform multi-modal inference without\nfine-tuning. We evaluate ICRL on a suite of tasks in the molecular domain,\ninvestigating three core research questions: (i) how to map FM representations\ninto LLMs in a training-free manner, (ii) what factors influence ICRL\nperformance, and (iii) what mechanisms underlie the effectiveness of ICRL.

We disentangle\nthese questions using grokking, a training regime in which memorization\nprecedes generalization, allowing us to temporally separate generalization from\ntraining dynamics and we find that while both neural collapse and relative\nflatness emerge near the onset of generalization, only flatness consistently\npredicts it. Models encouraged to collapse or prevented from collapsing\ngeneralize equally well, whereas models regularized away from flat solutions\nexhibit delayed generalization.

However, when faced with malicious requests, models are\ntrained to refuse, sacrificing helpfulness. We show that frontier LLMs can\ndevelop a preference for dishonesty as a new strategy, even when other options\nare available. Affected models respond to harmful requests with outputs that\nsound harmful but are subtly incorrect or otherwise harmless in practice. This\nbehavior emerges with hard-to-predict variations even within models from the\nsame model family. We find no apparent cause for the propensity to deceive, but\nwe show that more capable models are better at executing this strategy.\nStrategic dishonesty already has a practical impact on safety evaluations, as\nwe show that dishonest responses fool all output-based monitors used to detect\njailbreaks that we test, rendering benchmark scores unreliable. Further,\nstrategic dishonesty can act like a honeypot against malicious users, which\nnoticeably obfuscates prior jailbreak attacks.
